lets not forget that apple pay in 2014 required a brand new iphone in order to use it a significant portion of apples user base wasnt able to use it even if they wanted to as each successive iphone incorporated the technology and older iphones were replaced the number of people who could use the technology increased,neutral
here in nz 50 of retailers don’t even have contactless credit card machines like paywave which support apple pay they don’t like the high fees that come with these,negative
i will forever acknowledge this channel with the help of your lessons and ideas explanations now its quite helpful while youll just sit at your comfort and monitor your account growth,positive
whenever i go to a place that doesn’t take apple pay doesn’t happen too often it’s such a drag between ‘contactless covid’ habits and my getting the apple card i’ve gotten so used to apple pay that i get seriously annoyed when a store doesn’t take it it feels like a shock it’s crazy how quickly it took over my shopping routine i’ve officially been brainwashed by apple because now it feels so inconvenient to even carry a physical card in my pocket,negative
apple pay is so convenient secure and easy to use i used it while at the korean and japanese airports no need for physical credit cards,positive
we’ve been hounding my bank to adopt apple pay i understand why they don’t want to do it with the extra fees but its just so easy and quick at the checkout,neutral
we only got apple pay in south africa in 20202021 and it’s widely accepted,positive
for now i need both apple pay and the physical credit card,neutral
in the united states we have an abundance of retailers that accept apple pay but its still good to carry the physical card with you being there are still a large quantity of places that do not accept apple pay,positive

the lab is the most exciting thing in it ive seen for a while this is reallly going to shake up how the qualiity of even basic components are manufactured,positive
linus im an engineer and love the lmg content across all the channels very much looking forward to more lab content and hope your engineering team will get more on camera time and hosting roles,positive
there used to be a time where linus was the smartest guy in the room this video clearly shows that the team he has built are experts in their respective fields and make linus look like a child kudos to linus and lmg youve grown beyond what i imagined all the best,positive
holy crap i was looking at chroma systems back when i was designing power supplies looks like you guys went all out re the multimeter most oscilloscopes are terrible for making accurate voltage measurements 810 bit adcs they are just for looking at the waveforms,negative
i love the direction this channel is going most tech channels even the best trusted ones are going to review products based on their own experience or at most some things they can measure with their pc but youre really going to mathematically demonstrate if a product is a quality one and why it is love it,positive
i am more excited for the ltt lab than i have been for a lot of content for a while now as everyone seems to be saying its exciting to see how enthusiastic this new crew is to get things running,positive
i adore the working relationship linus has with his team 99 of employees walk on eggshells around their boss and i wish it could be more like this,positive
lmgs growth is honestly something to truly aspire for this is the content we want to watch more technical in depth engineering oriented and sciencebased content will make us consumers much much more educated on these topics thus when picking a product not only will we pick the best choice but well know exactly why we picked it which helps greatly with buyers remorse,positive
i love all the people ltt has added for labs clearly theyre knowledgeable and passionate about tech labs is gonna be killer love it,positive
linus just turn the key lights 180 and bounce them off the walls you’ll get a much softer glow and shadow and way more even lighting it’s such a simple fix i’m not sure where along the lines people got the idea to beam the lights directly at your face ,positive
dan continues to be my new favorite he has such an air of confidence about him and a comforting presence like dan shows up and you just know things are going to be fine,positive

dan the man saving the day riley needs to give him his own theme like brian the electrician,positive
dan continues to be a favourite for me hes like the incredibly patient but longsuffering dad who just gets on with things,positive
dan is a treasure your channel has long lacked a mr fixit type and while i am sad its not me dan appears quite capable and funny,positive
blows my mind how quickly dan became the rock upon which all things linus standslove it,positive
hey linus a good trick for streaming lights bounce them off the wall much easier on the eyes and a nice softer look also for indoors id recommend a hypercardioid mic looks like a short shotgun like the audiotechnica at4053b,positive

guys a quick note that you do not need all the highend tech in order to do well at college if you can and you should save as much money as you can while at college pay your tuition in full and student loans as soon as possible instead of spending on liabilities like gadgets get the bare minimum you need and only spend money on products you know you are going to be using for 46 years such as laptop dont overspend on phone headphones lamps tablets etc,neutral
this is hilarious i was in a focus group over 4 years ago for best buy where they were asking college students how to advertise for back to school one of the kids next to me said maybe you should have someone like mkbhd talk about your products well here we are,neutral
everyone has been saying it but i’ll throw my hat in as well to any prospective college students you do not need to spend money on flagship products i am about to graduate with a business degree and have been using a 7 year old laptop and the base ipad from late 2020 both products have worked flawlessly and i have no intention of replacing them the recommendations listed are ones i would never be able to afford even with my job i’m working as well do your own research on forums to see what your peers say the best value product is i promise that if you buy a flagship product you will quickly see that you did not need it,positive
shoutout to my oneplus phone and huawei laptop for getting me through university feeling premium for much less bonus ups for ikeas articulating lamps 20 and i can see all my homework incredibly well without eye strain the old door i refinished to use as a desktop and wired earbuds under hardware store earmuffs as my noisecancelling headphones and the same 2 sets of hanes underwear from target for also lasting the whole ride,positive
best buy we want to sponsor a back to school type video but you can only push the high end stuff marques say less,neutral
most of the items you recommend are pretty pricey for a student im not a student myself anymore but if i were one more budget alternatives would make this video a lot better,neutral
you dont necessarily need the highend and latest tech for university i used a 2009 macbook pro throughout my years at uni had an iphone 6 and it worked out just fine whats important is to remain focused on getting that degree and graduating,positive
personally i feel like this is really out of touch most students wont be able to afford these in case anyone needs it i believe dave2ds back to school video are honestly the best ones ive seen on the topic consider checking them out too before making a purchase decision,positive
hey everyone good take on the video and love the recommendations if you plan on making another video such as this maybe you can also include some more budget options and best value options what i can tell from my years of studying in college and university is that your tech and needs will be based on what coursesprogramme you took for your education engineering students require computer specs that can run bim software im not sure about the other programmes but from what i can see that most students at my place has 8gb of ram for their laptops also here is my setup during my university years hope it can help anyone who are looking to buy something for their collegeuniversity years all the best laptop asus x455l upgraded to ssd with additional ram phone vivo y69redmi 10samsung a22 4g mouse logitech g102 keyboard tecware tkl ver,positive
i have used galaxy tab s7 during my phd its been a lifesaver for me first of all it is really good for reading journals note taking and scribbling on the pdfs secondly it doesnt strain your eye that much when you use a computer or a laptop always at a fixed distance thirdly you get the premium version of noteshelf free with tab s7 and lastly if you are from a stem background and use a lot of illustrations or flow process diagrams you can draw those easily with the stylus on tab s7 i choose tab s7 over apple ipad air for its ease of use user interface and cost you get stylus for free with tab s7 and in most cases keyboard too with a huge student discount,positive
when he says hes a 400 year old beer wizard i believe him,neutral
this series is exactly what career day shouldve been such interesting and knowledgeable people,positive
regarding cans vs bottles at least in germany the bottle is more environmentally friendly since they get used again and again you bring the empty bottles to the local grocery shop they then get sent to a cleaning plant where they pressurewash the bottles inside and out with steaming hot water afterwards they get reused for beer the size and shape of most bottles is according to a standard so different brewers use the same bottles its far less energy intense than smelting and remanufacturing cans,neutral

seasoned craft brewery tour guide here and i’m so glad he ended on “drink what you like” sometimes people get weirdly judgmental about the beer preferences of others at the end of the day there are hundreds of beer styles for a reason so everyone can find at least one style they actually like,positive

mad respect to john oliver and his team for not making us watch ads during the show major props,positive
one important aspect im surprised was left out is that many of these companies like amazon literally power the internet almost 30 of the websites on the internet are stored on amazon servers giving them even more access to data trends and physical control over the internet,positive
shout to you john oliver for giving me a brief trip down memory lane ive been in the telecommunications industry for almost 25 years and my first job was atmci great company that got swallowed up in a horrible merger with worldcom bing it and see how that disaster played out,neutral
back in 2018 when john oliver did the episode on corporate consolidation it inspired me so much that i applied for a masters of research program got into a program and did my entire research thesis on tech oligopolies it was shocking to see how bad it really is oligopolies that bordered in monopolies are rampant my research essentially focused on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws caused this whole problem or whether lack of adequate laws were the core of the issue the answer was that it was truly both i thoroughly enjoyed my predoctoral masters thesis and am considering a phd in the future its so lovely to see john talk about this specifically on the tech sector edit wow thanks everyone for the great comments i havent published it yet otherwise i would share it with all you lovely people  i am now looking for a policy or qualitative researchanalyst job so if anyone is hiring let me know ,negative

i would love to see these bills live i live in a country where we had one company try and rule the internet charging outrageous prices for it they had specifically bought the copper network to do it the government of nz denied that as a defense as they were monopolising it and forced them to open up suddenly it turned out it didnt cost 300 to connect to unlimited internet you could get that for 80,neutral
hey something that might interest you a couple of days ago my amazon account was closed with no warning for after hours of wasted time theyre telling me its for excessive returns which i think is an error but thats beside the point when they closed my amazon account all my amazon devices that i own for years primarily all my echo devices stopped working i lost access to the amazon photos and prime video which i pay for so apparently the devices you already own are subject to be disabled by amazon on your perceived shopping habits i assume the same applies to all other amazon devices and services like fire os tablets ring cameras and probably aws as well just wanted to make other people aware of this because they definitely dont tell you this when you buy your hardware and services,negative
points that were missed apple arguably has a specific monopoly in the us with smartphones because of imessage not being open with other multiplatform messaging apps this weirdly only applies in the states the rest of the world favours things like whatsapp and facebook messenger both owned by meta which is its own issue thats probably the main defence apple will bring up theyve been in trouble before but dont forget about microsoft windows 11 has seen them go back to some of their old tricks like a favouring their own software and making it difficult to remove this kind of got glossed over but although google play takes the same cut for purchases as apple you are free to install other app stores and install apps from wherever you like so they avoid the heat there google play is still the most preferred store on android phones so google likely takes advantage of that fact in promoting its own software,neutral
hey hey just a heads up i did turn the led hoodie on its just not very bright hen youre looking faceon at it you can still sort of see it on around the hood area though  if you had fun on this video heres my collection of extreme unboxing videos,positive

i personally enjoy the old school phones i have such a hard time hearing my iphone at max volume without the speaker on if i worked in an office i would definitely buy one people forget how ergonomic those old phones are its not particularly comfortable holding a rectangle to your head i also have physically sensitive ears so any type of headphones ear phones whatever cause me a bunch of pain looks like a good product that can both be a gag and something for people out there like me who have a tough time using a regular mobile phone,positive
the fact he didnt buy the nicholas cage spoon is outrageous,negative
i have to say it after watching this video it feels like the journey youre on this year has been effective it simply feels like youre enjoying life and its what i enjoy most about watching your videos you manage to pass that joy on just the musings of a random stranger ,positive

if machines produce everything we need the outcome will depend on how things are distributed everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machineproduced wealth is shared or most people can end up miserably poor if the machineowners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution so far the trend seems to be toward the second option with technology driving everincreasing inequality stephen hawking,neutral
as somebody with a comp sci degree and a decent amount of irl experience i will say edge computing is problematic at its core because client side workload like this is a huge security breach this is why even online video games avoid client side scripting it is a huge vector for exploit it is always interesting to watch a video like this because you are blown away when you listen regarding these other technologies you may not know allot about but when they cover a technology you know about you realize you must question the quality of the info in the other cases where you cannot determine the quality yourself,negative

selfhealing concrete is on paper a really good idea there is just one small problem with it and comes from the fact that we are not using limestone for buildings as limestone has this one tiny problem with being rather frail yes it will make the concrete last a big longer but it will also make it harder to see where the weaknesses of the structure is and only really postpone the disaster if at all,neutral
ive read that hydrogen can work its way through any container material in your piece about graphen it was stated that it is impermiable to gases even the lightest one assuming the narrator meant hydrogen it might be a solution to the long term storage of hydrogen perhaps,neutral

i was totally shocked that fusion power generation wasnt included possibly as big a leap as quantum computing in its impact on humanity,negative
i love the one about the hydrogen fuel cellsconsidering this technology has been around for about 20 yearsjust hasnt been used due to a lack of pressure on the industry and the fact that the patent was buried by large corporate interests,positive

i wish that when people talked about types of skin damage theyd acknowledge what that looks like for people with darker skin we dont get red rashes after sunburn even my darkest bruises are often difficult to spot because of hyperpigmentation the stages of healing for cuts looks vastly different because we dont see the same change in colors around the wound sight not to mention when you look for images to identify clinical signs 99 of those images are of lighter skin and only marginally helpful to us looking to identify potentially serious medical issues,negative

i’ve been playing with the insta360 link for about a week now as a college professor and edtech trainer i can tell you that this is a complete game changer for online and hybrid teaching switching from follow mode to whiteboard mode to topdown mode for demos etc is a purely magical experience,positive
i honestly have to say while its still insanely expensive 3500 for that monitor isnt as bad as i was expecting and its almost reasonable like its still more than i would ever spend on a single display and im far more into having separate displays but given what its capable of the specs the tech behind it etc its not that bad i can see a few people getting real use out of something like that,positive
imagine losing the cursor on that screen and trying to find it ,negative

the whole idea of the interchangeable battery to keep going of the steel series is exactly the reason why xbox still uses aa batteries for their controllers i think is in an undervalued decision from xbox,negative
in my experience burnout comes from realizing that improved performance doesnt produce improved rewards it produces more work the response to a job well done is never a couple days off or a timely bonus instead good work is rewarded with the demand for twice as much work in the same amount of time firms see young workers as a productivity sponge to be squeezed for all its worth young people are almost never treated as the companys future,negative
i am 50 years old working in the high tech industry mentally tired and sick of the weekly 8 to 5 routine never got a proper day off even through the pandemic hats off to the millenials and genz that think differently and put more weight on living rather than just working,negative

i have a high paying tech job that i’m about to leave i feel incredibly blessed and privileged to have had it even though i worked hard to get to where i am i was promoted very fast after 5 years i know it’s something many people would love to have and honestly i’m happy that someone else who has worked hard will get my spot ultimately i became burnt out and just need some time to reset my life i have lived humbly saved every thing i could paid off debts as quickly as possible and have enough to live for 8 months to a year i’m hoping to come back into the industry as a healthier employee or have found something else fulfilling for anyone wishing they had one of these jobs or feel frustrated by people that appear to be complaining i hope you achieve your dream and get one you can do it keep at it taking one of these jobs to be financially secure is a blessing i am taking a break because my mental health and stress hospitalized me don’t let that scare you i just have my own personal stuff too ,positive
i’m a software developer i understand the struggle but us tech workers should count our lucky stars we are very privileged to be where we are most jobs outside of tech have less perks much lower pay and more stress i am grateful everyday to be in this field once i accumulate enough wealth to purchase my freedom i’ll see myself out maybe in the meantime i will run the race as long as i have to,positive
the thing is if you give someone all of these perks and a flexible schedule you need to also give them the freedom to use that flexibility you must make it clear that the company expects you to take down time and you will not be frowned upon either officially or unofficially leadership needs to model that behavior by taking time off and making sure everyone knows theyre taking time off this also empowers your teams letting them know that you trust them to work without constantly staring over their shoulders,positive
compare that to physicians only 42 said they were burned out yes indeed a perfectly acceptable percentage,positive
i worked a low paying tech job for six years and still felt the burn out the problem is that tech is very fast paced and competition focused you can barely keep up though i got promoted regularly my higher ups told me the truth before they left they said that i was severely underpaid based on my skills essentially i branded myself a one stop shop for the marketing department as i am both technically knowledgeable people oriented and strategic i maxed out at 50k so i decided to jump ship with little planned now i run a financial agency with my husband and we make 250k a year as entrepreneurs and we have the freedom to set our own lifestyle,negative

that motion alarm for protecting your laptop makes me laugh if you are taking a break away from your workplace do you really think that the alarm feature would deter a thief from simply knocking the device to the floor pick up the laptop and perhaps step on the alarm and crush it in a moment of disdain by the time you get back with your latte after your phone notifies you of your impending bad luck your laptop will be off on an extended trip,negative
that cable organiser would be incredible in my dorm room,positive
the trene control alarm will not deter someone who really wants it they will just knock that gadget off and run with your property,negative

i spent hours researching dash cams a year or so ago and it’s almost maddening how awful sparse and misrepresented information on dash cams is i was totally surprised how under developed they are this is a video that is really necessary,negative
vids like these are definitely a service for looking out for everyone to avoid buying crap and hype in dashcams well done in the research thanks ltt,positive
a favourite trick is to upscale a low resolution image before applying the compression that way they get to claim a higher resolution on the box ive analysed a few of these now,neutral
i did not expect to love this video as much as i did it epitomizes the very best of youtube in my opinion a wellmade video with a wellconstructed narrative hosted flawlessly and provides a genuinely good service to everyone even if they are not in the market for these products love your work ltt team,positive
thank you linus for spending the big bucks and testing all these cameras for our benefit i will be keeping your recommendations in mind when i purchase my camera,positive
this is the kind of content that we need calling out trash markets and helping people find honest answers doing the sidebyside comparisons they cant do thanks for this glad to know the rove r24k i got as a gift is not far from really the peak in the market and is good enough if not overpriced a bit,positive
yup its amazing though how the market then changes brands for each country in germany we have an entirely different line of knockoff chinese brands which ultimately look alike same goes for the australian american market i am kinda stoked to see though what sort of dashcams are actually used within south korea japan if anybody could give a hint to that i mean surely they must have great dashcams right japan being the leading technology country in the 80s and having a severe amount of car enthusiasts and well south korea being well the main birth place of any technology centre and fab well at least a good portion in my mind i bought this one due to a recommendation from a friend of mine problem i have with it is quality related the gsensor broke not long after i bought the thing and started using it kinda unfortunate this creates an issue of the thing constantly making emergency recordings and in that mode you cant disable the screen from flashing so at night drives youll really get beamed in your faze and think someone put a flashlight up to your head nope its your f dashcam you can improve further the video quality for eg when experincing intense sun glare which is usually caused on these by using a ndfilter you just have to find your own way to mount them usually there is full filter clamping solutions because youll have to overshoot with the filter anyhow i didnt do this yet as i did not find it nessecary to do so but a big german dashcam clip compilation maker did recommend this in one of his dashcam review videos half a year ago or so name of the channel is eure videos fahrnünftig german amazon thieye cv3211 american market jansite nexigo d80 australian nz market volway,positive
in all fairness the viofo actually looks pretty great actually worth considering over the thinkware f70 if the budget isnt too tight,positive
when i went looking for a dashcam my main criteria was that it has a super cap instead of a battery cause i really dont think the batteries would handle the 20 to 30c temps in winter and the exact opposite in the summer along with however much the sun heats up the interior i know you can take them off but i kinda wanted an install and forget about it kind of system for actual performance its much better to just find someone elses footage cause the resolution and other specs are very misleading unless you really know your camera sensor specs,negative
i had my suspicions about this for a long time thank you for finally calling this issue out it sounds like theres a hole in the market for a truly high quality dashcam thats not chinese crap hopefully some tech company sees this and swoops in im tired of all these countless trash brands on amazon with unpronounceable names,negative

honestly can’t wait for the camera testing you do on the pros as a iphone 8 user anything will be an improvement though lol,positive
i’ve been holding out cause i just felt it wasn’t worth upgrading but with everything coming to the 14 pro and the diminishing battery on my current iphone x it might be time to retire my phone after 5 years,neutral
definitely upgrading from my 12 pro max to the 14 pro max ill get at least half the cost of the new phone back with trade in major upgrade in battery camera and the screen,positive
in my opinion the 13 mini is the best phone ever made seems i’m in a minority but it’s brilliant,positive
eh i’m sticking with my 13 pro max until probably the 15 or 16 the cameras on the 14 pros are literally the biggest worthwhile change this year imo,positive
im going to wait for the scheduled iphone 15 pro which will be scheduled to release in october 2023 if everything goes to plan it is expected to have a usb c port and faster charging like the iphone 14 series this is what really matters for me,positive
im getting the pro been using the 12 pro max since it came out and i think its too big for one hand use,neutral
i might upgrade from my 11 pro to the 14 max i guess i don’t care enough to spend the money on the pro max but i want the bigger display and better battery life,positive

this was a fascinating look at something i love by some genuinely interested people i will add that you can build a significantly cheaper race bike for a lower key series and still have fun on the track i have a minitwin which is relatively cheap to run but a friend of mine has a litre plus missile and every time he crashes it it costs about £5k and six months at least to fix however i far prefer long adventure rides to whizzing around the track all of which you can do on a minitwin ,positive

what slowdown lol it was abnormally fast and now with the recession vcs realized many of these startups aren’t profitable so they laid off people the big ones are still hiring and tech adoption isn’t nearly as much for it to slow down anytime soon,negative

interesting note real wasabi is difficult to cultivate and package and ship it also grows only in a specific riverbank environment which makes real wasabi expensive and in low supply when young real wasabi is a bit sweet not spicy the wasabi that comes with your sushi dinner in america it is most often just horseradish with green food coloring this greendyed horseradish replacing actual wasabi is known in the food world as an ersatz or a replica food,neutral
that “section of the tongue” theory is so funny to me because it’s what i was taught as a fact in my high school anatomy class and i was trying to test that out on my own and never could i would always taste every flavor no matter where it was in my mouth i have never heard anyone say it wasn’t true so it’s cool to hear now,positive
this woman is unbelievably amazing i want a phd in taste and i want her to be my professor i’m a lawyer and after this one video i’m prepared to quit and pursue taste ,positive
what she said about the packaging affecting the taste is so true i always think delivery pizza smells so good and it’s the pizza in the cardboard box that makes it smell amazing just not the same without the box ,positive
when i was a kid in kindergarten we did an experiment with that old fake five flavors taste zones thing and i never got it i could always taste everything on every part of my tongue i felt vindicated like two decades later when it came out that that was horsecrap but i cant exactly go rub it in my kindergarten teachers face can i,negative

also the amount of carbonation to syrup isnt set in the soda machines and can be changed a soda with more carbonation is a dry soda a restaurant i loved would mix their own rootbeer syrup and you could ask for it to be a dry or sweet whichever was your preference,positive

i’m so glad she talked about how hearing aids are more complicated than just a mic and speaker as someone who has had two of them since i’ve been four i’ve had to explain that so many times also having automatic bluetooth ears is super cool,positive
my doctor also told me that our ears are selfcleaning but when i pressured her for some offtherecord advice she finally conceded that if i really really felt the need to clean inside my ear canal i could go ahead and use my elbows i just adore my doctor,positive

the charger was my favorite the hidden feature is cool but what i really like is the easy under the desk installation that also saves space,positive
what an awesome video i love to see new affordable products come out this makes me wonder why certain tech devices have such an immense shelf price if more technology can be produced at cheaper costs there may be some advancement in the asking price from many everydayused devices such as laptops or desktops,positive

ai is the most important one a lot of people think ai is going to somehow mean self awareness consciousness at some point the main implications of ai is that it is self improving the true ramifications of this are not yet known but what is going to happen is that ai is going to overtake humans in a lot of things including research and science it is going to snowball at some point and this is going to change everything about life far more than the industrial era did for example 300 years from now we can have an ai program that has been improving itself for 300 years we lose about 14 million people each year from car accidents and that is just fatalities there are also many more injuries so while i understand people being skeptical about machines driving cars as time goes on it is not even going to be close ai is going to be able to do many many things better than humans at some point these quantum computers are going to make ai they could program an ai to make a better ai of itself an improved version then the 2nd one can make a 3rd one that is better then it etc etc there is really no telling what this is going to do because we are not there yet but it is going to change things very rapidly when it happens,neutral

when i got right hooked a few years ago i only had time to think “this is gonna suck” and then proceeded to roll a ways on the pavement fortunately i came away with ‘only’ bruises and road rash nothing got broken and i think in part it was because i didn’t have a chance to put my hands out also glad i was wearing a helmet,positive

askgcntech after two years of running tubes i finally went tubeless a couple of months ago i managed to puncture my tyre the other day sealant didn’t do the trick nor did a couple of slugs even tried a patch inside the tyre the puncture was not on the sidewall and may have been 3mm large given the tire had plenty of life left i am gutted that i may have to discard the tire now when would you come to a decision that a tubeless tire is ko,negative
askgcntech riding in a strong crosswind the other day i wondered if a high cadence would give a gyroscope effect and reduce buffeting from the wind presumably from feet and shoes if so can ollie show us the maths please,neutral
my last crash 3 yrs ago i was on the ground so fast i had no time to react or prepare for the impact but the scar from my collar bone repair looks pretty cool,positive

1035 this is a common misconception while part of the reason was the battery being too thin the main issue was a manufacturing defect in the corner of most of the batteries at launch which was a tiny dent in the top left corner this would cause the battery to eventually short out as the dent caused both terminals to eventually touch each other most peoples phones were exploding while fast charging which was likely due to the increased power going through the battery and lithiumion batteries do not take well to being shorted out like that edit normally defects of that scale would be perfectly fine and would never cause issues but they made the battery too thin meaning it shorted it out easier just wanted to clarify that,negative

something important to know for all who are interested in history andor support ukraine rus’ ought not to be confused with “russia” which derives its name from the rus’ but historically is a completely different state which almost all its existence was at war with the rus’ just like the holy roman empire was actually germany russia is actually muscovy despite their best attempts to convince everybody otherwise its name “russia received only in 1721 when peter i passed a decree to change tsardom of muscovy’s name into the “russian” empire “russia” originates from rosia name used by the greek orthodox clergy in regards to kyivan rus under the reign of cathrine ii muscovites where even punished for continuing to identify as muscovites and were forced to call themselves “russian” lands that “russia” claims were part of the original rus’ but actually werent are novgorod suzdal and ryazan since in historical texts of xixii centuries they are mentioned as separate entities from rus’ they can be considered parts of extended rus’ although their culture was distinct from main rus’ in 1493 moscow prince ivan iii appointed himself to be the great ruler of all rus’ no other kings acknowledged that from that point on muscovy started to make false claims on rus’ ownership “russia” is an offshoot of ukraine and not the other way round despite what soviet and “russian” historians have been trying to say for years kiev was a developed cultured capital when moscow was just another swamp village germany used to call itself the holy roman empire that didn’t mean they became the romans and all of a sudden had a right to claim whole of italy and its history but yet that’s exactly what “russia” did in regards to rus’ukraine which is a horrible injustice,neutral

netflix is getting into video games for the same reason apple is launching a car and amazon is getting into healthcare these high high tech company have to constantly keep growing in order to justify their insane valuations and in many cases their core businesses wont offer enough revenue to satisfy investors growth expectations,neutral
netflix in a lot of trouble now especially as more market competition comes in from other distributors this move into gaming will not do them any favours,negative
the reason netflix is struggling is because they keep losing content their own content when its good is constantly neglected and they keep raising the price without adding commensurate value to justify it getting into games demonstrates that they are not recognizing what theyre doing wrong and simply trying to find a new source of revenue instead of fixing their faults people are getting sick of having the price increased while more and more good content disappears or takes far too long to update people are used to getting the next season of a series once every year but many of them are taking 2 to 3 years to release even before covid,negative
when i first got into watching netflix there were a lot of low budget but very original and interesting documentaries and tv series on it however in recent times i feel like a lot of the diversity in the platform has gone,positive
this is the problem with these big companies their core offering starts to fail and they think moving focus elsewhere is the answer instead of making sure their core offering is decent,negative
i worked in retail for most of my life and the one thing i have never forgotten is the fact that once you lose a customer you are going to play hell trying to get them back regardless of what you do,negative
i think it’s so silly that netflix feels the need to compete with youtube and tiktok i think these platforms should be able to exist together in harmony as they each offer very different products eg people can follow along with reactionsreviews and video essays while watching a netflix series people also don’t typically like when youtubers are given a large budget like with youtube red originals so netflix buying out certain youtubers is not the right idea…,negative
honestly maybe it would have made more sense to commission more games based on their original ips yeah it takes longer to come out but you’ll get better quality and hopefully better return on investment,positive
i think this is gonna take netflix back to its feets it just needs more perseverance and the ability to be positive minded,positive

im surprised getting all the collectibles didnt even get an honorable mention theres been more than enough people who couldnt 100 the arkham games simply because they didnt like the riddler trophy collecting quest especially arkham knight due to how many times you had to use the batmobile just for those collectibles,negative
the one that annoyed me was the borderlands 1 when to obtain you had to play online with someone from gearbox or with someone who already had the trophy they changed it for the rerelease to playing with three players at once,negative

the original infamous hurt my soul i played through the campaign twice on hard to get the platinum only to find out while i was doing cleanup that the stunt master trophy cant be completed post game i had all but one stunt to knock 3 enemies off a roof at once when you clear out an area enemies no longer spawn in large numbers therefore there isnt enough enemies to get the stunt i didnt have it in me to start another campaign the sad part is i had tried the stunt on multiple occasions only for it to glitch and not award the stunt,negative
ac3 was super annoying when first released because of having to pass the mission the first time without any retry problem was the controls were clunky af and the goals of the missions most of the time were annoying or without too much logic like do not touch water,negative

i adopted a mindset of delaying my gaming brain by a year if a game comes out in 2022 i wait until 2023 i get it at its cheapest and usually complete i have been doing this with every game i buy for the last 5 years and i have saved so much money while enjoying the games much more,positive
i used to preorder games to get the “collectible” toy that was sought after the items got really cheap really fast not worth it they also tell you that there may not be enough copies that never happened there was always enough copies,negative
good video these are the kinds of topics and discussions the gaming industry needs to need to be having now publishers developers the media and gamers themselves have to throw one in though for every game with a yearly release i also have to point out games with decade or more release cycle how long between gta 5 and 6 fallout 4 and 5 skyrim and elder scrolls 6,positive
i wish developers would realize that forced drm and internet connectivity for games is a step backward look at the debacles gt7 and simcity have endured whats the point of paying a full 70 for the game if there is no guarantee you can play it at your leisure especially if this ridiculous requirement is in place for singleplayer modes in my opinion at that point you cant help but wonder if spending time with the game is either fun or just another full time job this is not why people play games,negative
when i think about the games i played the last few years i must say that i almost always enjoyed indie titles alot more than big ips so i rather pay 30€ for an indie title that is really inspiring with fresh new ideas than wasting 60€ on a broken aaa title without any innovations,positive
great vid points are spot on only 4 or 5 years ago feels like i bought every major release at midnight and after cyberpunk fallout no mans sky i’m never buying a day one game again my gaming and spending habits have completely changed the gaming biz can’t devolve and expect players to keep up the old pace,neutral
i havent bought a game on release for the past 6 years now the gaming industry has changed for a while now and its only getting worse i buy 34 games per year at most and usually heavily discounted quality multiplayer games are a rarity nowadays cod and battlefield lost their way quality single player games are still a thing but are often filled with bugs on release so i wait it out and buy goty editions usually and often second hand gotta love disc edition systems i refuse to fuel bad descions made by money hungry devs or publishers,negative
i tend to stick to games made before 2010 as they give the best value and experience feels like games were made for fun rather then rip off the player,positive
this video made me a bit sad made me realise how the industry has changed and not for the better i have young children so can’t game like i used to but when i do have time i find myself increasingly drawn back to older games that i’ve played before but adore the vast majority of new games just don’t appeal to me as for the new gen consoles…what’s the point all they seem to be doing is rereleasing older gen games yawn,negative

ive been around for every console generation i remember thinking during the genesisturbografx era snes not out quite yet what games would be like when i was old and the kind of specs they would need obviously i had no idea what the specs really meant back then but i was thinking 256bit lol as for the cpu and 64bit is all we really need for that they have happily progressed faster than i had imagined looking just as good today if not better then i imagined things would look like 2025 years from now the 1990s and early 2000s with the massive clock speed increases and the advent of the gpu were the main things that took us to where we are hardware wise,positive
we are an architecture and construction company in chile and we have used unreal engine for a long time and it is the best for realtime visualization  the preview versions of unreal 5 were already spectacular and the best thing is the lighting lumion really changed everything its great that this is being talked about not only in games but also in movies and other experiences like ours there are plenty of tutorials to learn  we did it that way out of fear to learn it,positive
i think id like more deformable terrain breaking glass environments affected by weather systems world changes that arent static and that change etc and improved methods of moving like verticality rather than just wasd it feels like more fidelity comes at the expense of exploring deeper game modes imho,neutral

im over the moon hyped for the day before i hope it delivers in the hype like elden ring did if thats even possible for developers other than fromsoft,positive
most games these days look mind blowing especially when you can remember when gaming pretty much first started with games like pong etc,positive
i think we’ve reached the point that these devs need to come up with better idea and aí for decades now they just been able to make games look better a lot of games are actually worse gameplay wise with stale ideas and dumbed down mechanics than older games,negative
these games look insane cant wait to play some of them great list by the way,positive

whats your dream specsize for a gaming monitor,neutral
wow im impressed think theyve set a new bar with that spec and it being a 42,positive
this monitor looks really clean with almost no bezels i like how it’s got a tilt adjustable stand as well nice video,positive
on your future review will you give us a comprehensive analysis on the antiglare matte screen is the matte coating embedded within the panel or is it another layer do you notice any sacrifices on color and sharpness because of the matte finish do you find its brightness setting to be adequate for an oled monitor during productivity use how aggressive is abl in your testing please let us know thank you,neutral
my favorite part of this tv 42 is basically tv size is the custom heatsink i dont care too much about the size of the back of the monitor as long as it doesnt dim the brightness constantly,positive
great video i think ill still be leaning toward the c2 though as the £400 price difference at the moment is too appealing,positive
awesome review what are your thoughts on the picture quality compared to the lg c2 42 does the matte coating make a noticeable difference to the picture quality i want to get a new monitor for work and gaming but not sure if i should get the c2 at a cheaper price this or perhaps wait another year for something new,positive
oled gaming wow please compare to the c2 you had as a monitor side by side to see that contrast difference uniform brightness difference etc for those comparing the c2 42 and this love your content,positive
thanks for the review i cant wait for your full review my dream spec for a gaming monitor would be pretty close to this 42 inches or so antiglare normal aspect ratio not ultra wide but 1440 200mhz instead of 4k because not even a 3090ti will do anywhere near 4k 138mhz in most decent looking aaa titles anyway if possible i had a couple of suggestions for things to look at over the course of your full review what do resolutions other than 4k look like on the monitor try playing a game in 10801440 and seeing what the monitors scaling is like in the settings what hdr options are available thanks,positive
hi spawnpoiint im looking forward to the complete review youre the most thorough and thoughtful reviewer ive seen one thing id like to see in the review is a comparison with a matte screen ideally a sidebyside in different conditions to illustrate the pros and cons and help us decide what coating we prefer dont know if thats feasible for you in any case thanks for the work and enjoy,positive

theory karl is actually the master mind behind everything that has happened in the long drive and he is testing you,neutral
theory why karl has a wierd collision box hes a mesh thats not supposed to be in the game but evreyone likes him so the devs just left him,neutral
theory the reason why you saw a second karl might have something to do with abandoned cars like cristine karl is the first abandoned car and over time it withered and due to the desert heat its paint melted all over it making it all covered in blue paint and eventually a bunny accidently glitched in there and died and theyre soul got sucked in creating the first karl which then killed the player and over time the karl became more and more smart and even attained sentience and started converting other cars into karls and karrot and karla were his first ones which had a few problems which is why they are diffrent eventually karl found out about you and how many times you abandoned cristine and the last time you did he converted all of the old ones he kept on finding new ones not going back and getting them back and are now mad at you and your stupid sedan it also explains why he keeps coming back,neutral

gotta love lenovo got the ryzen 5600h version of this laptop with the same 3050 after seeing the positive reviews you guys gave it and i couldnt have been happier it was 700€ in italy at the time paired with my wacom cintiq and a ram upgrade its been the perfect little gaming and digital painting set up,positive

lenovo always been crazy in the budget gaming laptop market my first introduction to pc gaming was a 1080p lenovo with sli 750ms was a killer deal too back when the 7 series was nvidias newest line i remember looking up so many videos about its performance in games weeks before i got it i havent gotten anything lenovo since as i build my own towers now and get much more premium laptops but i will always appreciate and respect what lenovo does,positive

i got the controller alone for use on my pc and im shocked that it works so natively well of course none game that i know of uses the trigger gimmick but the soundvibration feedback works like a charm sure it does require some set up but it works,positive
i honestly think marques should start a gaming channel only so we can appreciate him enjoying his tech in the way most people will do being very analytical and knowledgeable about tech is a great benefit to those who come to this channel but there is a slight otherworldliness to seeing some talk about tech in a matter of fact way and not seeing them actually use it in a real world environment and showing that they actually enjoy the thing they are criticisingwhich to be fair no one with sense would think he doesnt enjoy his tech but seeing it would be a great addition,positive
the controller really is the coolest thing about the ps5 astro’s playroom is insane with the haptics,positive

the part where theyre talking about the initial rollout of the snes in north america hits home they mention something about how expensive it was for the time and how the state of the us economy in 1991 meant it was probably the only toy the average american parent could buy their kids that year took up the entire toy budget that happened to my family christmas 1991 and all my brothers and sisters are there 4 of us ranging from 10 to 18 years old my parents had a single present for the 4 of us the super nintendo with super mario world it was one of the best gifts of all our lives because we had all wanted the snes badly we literally played it all that christmas eve night and into christmas day its a great family memory that we all still hold with us now all in our 40s and 50s with families of our own,neutral

1442 this is the most painful one on this list if you ask me out of all the premature celebrations out there resulting in losses this ones just different the game was over lol its not like someone tripped you up before getting a touchdown the game is literally over all you do is hold onto the ball for a couple seconds and thats it the washington wizards were up by 3 at that point even if the apposing team has time to foul you you hit just 1 free throw and its over even if you miss both they have to somehow rebound the ball and go for a full court shot to tie the game in an impossible amount of time long story short that throw lost them the game after ot lol just look at his fellow teammates staring at him in total disbelief afterwards gotta be one of the worst throws in sports history,negative

3 wins won’t guarantee us a top 4 finish but it’s better than 3 defeats which is where we were last season,positive

watching gabriel jesus in this team right now honestly puts such a huge smile on my face him and odegaard just fit so well together and the interplay between them and the wings is just so fun to watch finally happy watching arsenal play again,positive
compared to the same time last year i feel like im living in the cloud 9 3 games 3 wins 9 points 9 goals scored with only 2 goals allowed can you believe that for ones like tierney tomiyasu and smith rowe who were main starters for arsenal last season we will definitely need their contribution more as the season goes by i hope they can be patient grab the opportunities and show what they are capable of on the pitch as the season keep going on compared to the last season this is a huge improvement the squad depth is so much thicker that we are using tomiyasu smith rowe and tierney as substitutes hopefully next week i would like to see vieira to make a debut even if its just for 10 or 20 minutes,positive

very entertaining one thing amazing about sports are the things that happen that are unexpected i remember my wife was given a free ticket to a diamondbacks game which went zerozero so she finally left and when she came home she said i got bored with the game the diamondbacks went on to score seven runs in the last inning after she left winning the game i teased her endlessly after that suggesting she should not attend more dbacks games and they went on to win the world series that year my wife not in attendance but glued to their last game with the yankees and luis gonzalez base hit that won the game i met joe montana and that football season he went on to win his last superbowl and i saw the ending in french in montreal in 90 during my flight from sfo to toronto and the connecting flight to montreal our air canada pilot gave us updates on a onesided blowout i also will never forget the stanfordcal game in 82 and the play when cal beat stanford and the band became part of the game some still argue over two of the lateral passes but the win for cal was as it was and i still say that is among the craziest moments in sports history my own crazy moment was when i was called in to play center for our grammar school flag football team even though i was the smallest player on ours and the opposing team the school we played had no players above the sixth grade so i agreed we won the game though i had only played center in school practice and never in a competitive game adrenalin had me psyched and our qb said i threw perfect spirals i would intimidate the bigger players since they feared id plow under them and stop them from getting to the qb and they never did he was not sacked our team went on to win the norcal championship undefeated in our twelve team league my brother playing as wide receiver though i no longer had to play since the school had seventh and eighth graders i never went on to play in high school feeling i was too small to be as good as i was in my grammar school game where i also played on the defense and i stuck to distance cycling and golf both of which i enjoyed and also had many crazy moments and i was decent at the 440 as it was then now the 400 meters even in my early 60s now and despite a leg i broke badly in a freak accident a couple of years ago i still enjoy cycling as well as hiking and also laser tag and go kart racing on my channel here cactus521 i even have a video of me jumping off the vegas stratosphere tower when i was 52 though the wind was so fierce my eyes watered i felt peace and not fear on the way down choosing that vs skydiving as my free fall bucket list item since there is no reason to jump out of a perfectly good airplane ,positive

3 games in to the season might seem like a bit too soon to be worried about this liverpool team but the early indications are that the liverpool midfield is literally paper thin when it comes to resources as a long time lfc supporter i cant help but compare the decision to let sadio mane go to the same situation with xavi alonso some years back i think that j klopp is going to have to put in some serious time working with this squad to get anywhere close to a top 4 position this year hope i am wrong but if i am being honest man utd should have been 40 up at halftime,negative

it’s crazy how much haaland can affect the game even with few touches his runs are always pulling players and opening up space for city to play once they start getting used to him being there for tap ins too it’s gonna be even scarier,negative
haaland should’ve gotten the ball a couple times however he opened up so much space just by being on the pitch he is a threat and the teams know it,neutral
kevin de bruyne world class as usual haaland shouldve at least gotten on the scoresheet if foden squared him in but at least he got an assist he can still find a way to contribute without goals,positive
seems like man city still haven’t fully adapted to haaland at least 2 more goals would’ve been scored if they had given him the ball in the right areas,neutral

i hope they keep adding sports always had a blast with boxing,positive
this game looks fantastic it originally seemed like a barebones sequel to the wii games but its shaping up to be a really fun experience character customization tons of modes great music and visuals online and free updates im happy hopefully more sports will be added beyond golf id love to see baseball and boxing make a return,positive
this game looks great i cant wait to play it the badminton especially looks like it will be a lot of fun and the survival bowling is such a cool idea will definitely be buying this when it comes out,positive
when it comes to in game customization i go crazy for it so far from what i’ve seen if that in this game i’m super hyped,positive
i absolutely loved baseball in wii so i hope it comes as a dlc since golf is coming i really hope they continue adding sports,positive
it’s crazy how this is my mostanticipated game right now i always wanted a more fleshed out version of wii sports and this looks to be it hopefully we get some of the resort sports added later on,positive
i mostly want this due to the customization i would love to see some nintendo themed outfits in the game maybe as prizes for online events it would be cool to wear splatoon outfits or dress up as mario characters for example,positive
would be cool to see more sports getting in the game via updates would love to see waterpolo surfing kayaking as water based sports ice hockey skiïng and snowboarding as winter sports but also skating skateboarding basketball baseball as more summer based sports i could see a very special potential for other uses for the leg strap like keeping in balance in surfing and snowboarding making a triangle shape to break in skiïng and do some tricks like flips in skateboarding,positive
one of the biggest things i had against this game was the lack of miis but its nice to see that theyre here i will definitely buy this game,positive

team jesus  comment down below if your on his winning team ,positive
finally finally a properly done highlight video no annoying commentating and no useless history on the players or the plays play after play after play awesome job,positive
the simpson flip really is incredible looks like something youd see in a movie about someone gaining super powers and taking advantage of it by playing football,positive
i’m not a golf fan but that putt is one of the most impressive things i’ve ever seen in sports,positive
i thought i was going to end up skimming or closing out this video early but this video was very well edited i was hooked on each play back to back without feeling bored the audio also was well balanced too and didnt have to worry about the next play being too loud or too soft just like what drummer386 said a couple months ago awesome job,positive
also the missed free throw by steven adams to get the rebound and immediately know where westbrook was to pass it to him was amazing he knew exactly where he was and they were able to get a shot off from the miss before the other team even knew what happened lol,positive
has one of the most incredible plays in golf ever commentators wow… nice,positive
336 never gets old the very definition of situational awareness,positive
156 wow the accuracy to make that ball come back to him exactly where he needed off the rim is impressive tiny bit too low or high and it wouldn’t have worked,neutral
that forward flip where he partially vaults off the other player is amazing even if you could practice for a thing like that itd still be hard to pull off,positive
doesn’t matter who we buy at this point once they’re here they’ll regress beyond recognition,negative
i think casemiro is a quality player and a quality singing i don’t believe he’ll be ‘unmotivated’ because he’s won everything he’s a world class cdm which we need but it’s madness that we’ll be paying that money for him at this point in the window crazy it reeks of absolute desperation,negative
with the way things are going it will be marouane fellaine at 1159pm on deadline day,neutral
quality player is casemiro also a dm which weve cried out for the concern with this signing though is how much more motivation will he have to still achieve having won everything multiple times over at madrid we are said to pay him an eyepopping 400k a week is what ive heard thats typical united one of our biggest problems has been paying insane wages resulting in comfortable unmotivated players who we then cant move on when its time as i say quality player but just seems like one that may help to stabilise us a bit more again but wont helps us achieve anything substantial as for pulisic ive always been quite underwhelmed by him albeit you can see he does possess good quality i probably wouldnt be averse to a loan though it cant be any worse than banging our heads against a brickwall hoping rashford does anything productive every week,negative
one question i have is will ten hag play casemiro when he joins united or will he stick to the 2 greatest midfielders ever played football mctominay and fred,neutral
the reality is that when he was at ajax ten hag didnt choose the players at ajax they have a solid recruitment area full of great ex players at manchester united,positive
we are a absolute mess if casemiro was the target why wasnt he signed 2 months ago we just panic and buy whoever with no strategy man im not saying casemiro is a rubbish player he is quality its just man utds approach to signings is a joke plus im not overly keen on giving a 30 year old a 5 year contract at 250k a week but ill literally take anything over scott and fred,negative
casemiro would be a fabulous signing for us i can’t bear to watch mctominay play again,positive
if casemiro joins current man utd then it will be his beginning of the end of his career let he continue in madrid,neutral
united have 2 big transfer problems right now 1 literally everyone in football knows how bad the situation is at united and it means alot of good players are simply going to refuse to go here regardless how much money we offer them haaland is a good example 2 the players we can get the clubs they play for know how desperate we are and are naturally gonna jack up the price to get as money money as possible,negative
west ham look terrible thus far graham potter is doing incredible things at brighton,negative
someone forgot to tell west ham pl started earlier this season,neutral
brighton is the team people are actually sleeping ontheyre in a good standing at the moment but nobody is paying attention,negative
dont sleep on brighton i would like to see them in europe one day,positive
brighton looking good even though they lost couple good players,positive
unfair because brighton and hove albion have two teams against west ham’s one,neutral
west ham genuinely has a solid squad… bad start to the season,neutral
kehrer was lucky the foul occurred on the line for a penalty otherwise hes likely sent off for denying a goalscoring opportunity outside of the penalty area,neutral
moi and pervis and hopefully if sarmiento picks his level up i hope these three ecuadorian men play together they sure will do a high offensive playing style,positive
brighton doing everything right very good team,positive
probably the best game ive seen from harry maguire in a long time his absence from the game was pivotal in uniteds win,positive
ten hag was on the pitch 45 minutes before the warmup placing cones and balls in precise spots his body language was full of intensity and concentration he looked like a man on a mission,positive
this is a good coach hes clearly a floor general and knows how to drive results this is the guy you want you to lead your team especially if they have been so illdisciplined like united has for the last few years if this was basketball he is the type of point guard you want hes got excellent standards and definitely the mindset of a champion,positive
as a liverpool fan i have to say that i admire how ten hag approached this game he is great to listen to honest and intelligent not afraid to leave out some big egos for the greater interest of the team respect,positive
ten hag has found the best position for maguire not a single forward passed him not a single mis passed ball not a single foul not a single defensive error leading to goal keep it up maguire,positive
so refreshing to have a manager whos not afraid to make big decisions,positive
the tactical position of maguire was class ,positive
from my point of view the selection of varane is decisive when the defense lacks solidity all areas of the game suffer his presence and the quality of his interventions gave confidence to the whole team including martinez who was also much more efficient i wonder if in reality varane is not the man of the match even without being the best on the field sometimes the balance of a team depends on very little,neutral
i loved ten hags comment the other day about he has always had slow starts at every club he managed but he always got the job done he has total belief in himself it showed on the pitch last night that the players have belief now too,positive
so now the question becomes did they raise themselves just because it was liverpool or has ten hag become the first coach in a long time at that club to actually instill an attitude shift in his players,neutral
people are not talking about how much of an effect the altitude had on leon it’s crazy bring that belt home rocky and defend it at wembley another w incoming mate ,neutral

“look at me now” what an iconic speech the whole thing,positive
the most amazing thing about this is how leon shone on the mic hes never been regarded as much of a talker but this might be best post fight interview ever its got it all cold one liners tear jerking passion a roaring crowd and bedlam in the stadium watched this so many times already,positive
so many people said edwards didnt even deserve the shot most underrated most disrespected fighter in the sport casuals with opinions baffling look at him now leon edwards is the quintessential gray man dark horse he does not train at altitude and epo dope so the altitude really affected his output throughout the fight the headkick was well read and calculated incredible,negative
every time he says look at me now i feel it happy for him ,positive
leon has done the uk proud all the hurdles he’s had in his career all the doubters and to silence everyone and beat the p4p number 1 was great to see ,positive
this has me hyped for work about to clock in and scream “you’s all thought i’d be late look at me now” congrats leon,positive

arteta finally getting some credibility if partley stays healthy and jesus keeps his form arsenal can challenge city for the title,positive
the result is better than what was expected arsenal are performing better than anticipated the next actual challenge is villa not man u,positive
can we get a second season of all or nothing with arsenal i would love to see how players are reacting behind the scenes,positive

great video guys this channel definitely deserves more subs than a lot of other car review channels its the gt4rs for me here with the 296 a close second,positive
well done car magazine but i will take porsche state of art on wheels,positive
wonderful group of cars i would have a tough time choosing between the lotus gt4rs i thought the color combo on that ferrari was in poor taste it does not look good to my eyes,negative
i feel like the 765 doesn’t belong in this list at all almost unfair,negative
id love any of those with the exception of the lotus in this company it looks outclassed in every department for me the one that offers the best combination of performance desirability and of being obtainable would be the maserati,positive
765lt is on a different level to any of the others in practically every way,neutral
how gorgeous is the mc20 in comparison to the 296 i love the rear 34 of the 296 but its just ugly from the front the mc20 with a mc12 livery would be my choice i think would need the opfs removed though to get some better sound out of it or the lotus and pay off my house p p,positive

gabriel jesus has seriously fit into this squad like a glove two goals and two assist is amazing saka looked a bit quiet today but it’s probably due to his fitness not being up to speed this early on zinchenko did good and marteneli fried fofona who looks like he’s about ti go for 80 millif we get another signing i’ll be happy this team is looking very promising,positive
love the start of this season so far arsenal need to keep their confidence up in order to take control over games and win them coyg,positive
you can still see how saliba is solid even after the miscommunication mistake what a gem,positive
the fans clapping for saliba after the own goal said it all for me the fans are behind this group great win the score line could’ve been much higher coyg,positive
gabriel jesus has been amazing for arsenal hes merged quickly into this arsenal side playing magnificently arsenal by the looks of it have a good season ahead of them,positive
the chemistry and youth of this arsenal squad is crazy top four finish this year and if they improve even further then theyll definitely compete with city and liverpool next season,positive
xhaka had a really good game criticize him when it’s justified no doubt but you also have to praise him when he deserves it goal assist,positive
gabriel jesus really showing pep that they didn’t need to look for anyone “better” he’s pure class at any club he goes to,positive
will be interesting to see how far arsenal’s defense will take them this year they have plenty of offense,positive

kristen youre like the only youtuber i constantly watch i feel like i connect with you in so many ways,positive
confidence isn’t “i know they’ll like me” it’s “i’m okay if they don’t”,neutral
hes right ive always loved studying the gestures and language of appealing characters and i come across as confident most of the times to the point where people are surprised when i tell them i have anxieties and various inner struggles like we all do its not about feeling perfect its about knowing you deserve to be where youre at and accepting that you might feel uncomfortable at times,positive
i think fake it till you make it is really important when it comes to confidence you need to practice it in order for it to start coming naturally appearing confident even when you dont feel confident i believe can prevent confrontation or becoming a victim in some circumstances,positive
anyone who has seen an infant stare at someone unselfconsciously or do almost anything that infants and pretoddlers do will understand that we are indeed born confident i think fear and inhibition are learned and later have to be unlearned if we are to regain our initial confidence now that we have an intellectual understanding of it,neutral
honestly i feel like confidence comes naturally when you care about something so much that you are no longer sensitive to how people see you and how you appear in front of others like jane goodall or colin powell im a person that has a mission thats important to me plus huge experience and knowledge that built me and im proud and what the world thinks is not my concern,positive
confidence can be very quiet finally someone said it thank you,positive
i was born confident and as a little girl i was constantly scolded for being too bold or outspoken now i own it again and found joy in life like when i was true to myself,positive
the presenter here delivers his knowledge succinctly he is the example of what he is teaching thank you for a concise no extraneous lesson it is has been immensely helpful,positive
i have adhd so usually its hard for me to focus on talks speeches and so on but when someone is really good at speaking and confident about what theyre saying i tend to pay more and even full attention i paid full attention to this video and even remember what i learned after watching only once this is my 2nd time here just to make sure i dont forget,positive
to me confidence means being happy with who you are having that inner peace with the person you are,positive
this guys body language tells me that he is uncomfortable with this interview and that he is withholding information,negative
he’s definitely someone who can make you admit everything just by his personality,positive
an important caveat is that when interviewing anyone you need to establish a “baseline” for their individual body language maybe they are naturally more nervous or nervous because of the situation so you first ask questions you already know answers to to see how they react watch how they move when they tell the truth figure out their “normal” then you can ask calculated questions and see if there is deviation you are looking for clusters of indicators not isolated indicators,neutral
im glad that those signs he laid out at the beginning were myths ive put so much effort over the years into avoiding showing these signs by accident so i dont come across as untrustworthy and when i do them by accident i always felt like im somehow maliciously deceiving people or myself without knowing about it this puts my mind at ease selfsoothing if you will,positive

god his children must’ve had such a hard time lying to him,negative
the guy is giving a simplified summary for total beginners and people think it is an exact account if the methods they use agents have spoken with innocent and guilty people their knew how to account for simple nerves and a guilty person they know how to establish a baseline to account for individual traits and most importantly none of this can be used too convict you they cant just say yep hes the murderer he is lying and throw you in prison it is just a tool to help then when interrogating so they can have an idea if when they are being lied too or who they should focus on they still need to investigate and find actual proofv to convict you if you didnt do it they cant convict you just because you seemed like you were lying,negative
i remember i was in an argument with a friend if mine and i crossed my arms she instantly called me out on it and said if im being open and honest then why did i cross my arms thats a defensive stance later i found out that this was meant and a self sooth which i find more realistic that situation was stressful for me so crossing my arms made sense i do that when im anxious or upset,neutral

i love what camielle said about french girls finding what suits them their body and what they like and dressing according to that not following trends but buying staple pieces that will fit your wardrobe and last a long time i really love that fast fashion has ruined our sense of style some people only buy a piece because its trendy then the trend passes and they forget about that item and throw it out and the cycle continues with the next trend,positive

being succinct is great now how long will it take for you to learn that people dont appreciate being mislead or flat out lied to do another ted talk when you figure that part out side note youve known this information for a long time this is why the most important information is buried at the bottom the media uses it to their advantage which is why in most cases the first half tends to be pointless and boring or aimed at narrative people stop paying attention so never get to the actual information,negative
i dont have time it is not a priority time is elastic time is a choice totally agreed thank you so much for the talk,positive
this is hands down one of best talks i have heard thanks for such a wonderful lesson,positive
well i have finished watching it and i found it really useful here are some lessons i learnt i dont have time it is not a priority time is a choice it is elastic we have enough time almost all of us make the experiences enjoyable such as you can read or listen to a book while commuting get rid of things that take away most of your time on a daily basis focus on what matters and you will build the live you want,positive
make yourself a threecategory priority list for the coming week career relationships self and there should be 23 items in each category small moments can have great power you can use your bits of time for bits of joy even if we are busy we have time for what matters quoting her,positive
we are so obsessed with time just like someone already said in the comments but on the other hand we will always find time for the things that truly matter to us and thats what laura vanderkam says in her talk i used to rush myself on the bike to school and i love cycling but i wanted to be there as fast as possible so that id have more time to study yet every time i would rush through id be stopped at the red lights and the slower cyclers would catch up with me making me feel frustrated with the time i was wasting waiting at the red lights all i was left with was more sweat frustration and muscle pain so i decided this was not going to do it now i cycle every morning to school at a slow pace enjoying the nature the rain the sunshine the wind the smells of life everything listening to the city or the birds i even have time to stop if i see a cat and try to give it some snacks i arrive at school feeling relaxed and ready for the day its my favorite thing to do now making a priority list will make your life better especially the relationships and self categories taking time to just be present in the moment and live ignore the smartphone and technology as long as possible and talk to your loved ones instead or instead of procrastinating by scrolling through facebook watch a ted talk you wont feel like youve wasted your time after that thanks for the inspiring talk im getting back to work now time to review my priority list,neutral
we dont build the lives we want by saving time we build the lives we want and time saves itself ,positive
ive had varying work schedules and it was incredibly hard to adjust to night shifts at first mainly because it was hard to find time to hang out with friends and family this video has taught me that priorities can change they might take some getting used to but it showed me that a night job doesnt have to mean no social life,neutral
every minute i spend is my choice how great is this sentence,positive
i like her approach and its partly right but i do believe that the things that we want to do during the week could be postponed for other reasons too and not only because we dont count them as priorities for example its not the same having free time in the morning and having free time at 2300 the opportunities for doing certain things are less kids are in bed shops are closed etc also when you want to meet other people you need to find some hours in which you are both free and its not super easy to happen,neutral
i love this womans attitude shes funny captivating and interesting too for me step 1 of controlling my time would be to stop watching youtube though,positive
i know at least 5 ways to deal with them 1 never take their words personally always have this suspicion in mind that they do not wish good for you so you shouldnt trust their opinion of you 2 dont compete with them it is futile and drains your energy 3 if they attack you stay calm indifferent and if possible give them a sneaky compliment the odds are they are used to people attacking them back and it takes them off guard when you see the positive things in them rather than the negative 4 dont become them if they are negative be positive if they lie tell the truth if they speak behind your back speak to their face always lead with example because they might not simply have the skills to do that 5 do not trust them dont tell them personal details about your life or things they could use against you keep your distance and value your boundaries protect yourself,negative
you will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you true power is sitting back and observing things with logic true power is restraint if words control you that means everyone else can control you breathe and allow things to pass,neutral
repeat after me its safe to set boundaries with difficult people no matter what they say or feel i am safe,positive
this only works if all people involved are reasonable if one or more parties cant be reasoned with then the problem continues you can communicate until youre blue in the face but if the other person isnt willing to communicate appropriately then youve hit a brick wall,negative
their bad behavior shouldnt be the cause of your heartattack brilliant,negative
long story short keep the convo brief simple cool calm and level headed only give one word answers than a full sentence don’t give them the benefit of the doubt be the bigger person and do yourself a favour and save yourself from that heartache trust me when i say this it works every time giving them a reason to whine and complain and talk about said drama only repeats itself if you give them the time and energy to do it when they get less of that well the difficulty becomes easier to manage ,neutral
cannot communicate with sociopaths on any reasonable level people who cannot empathize will never see things from your point of view someone who is a sociopathic master manipulator can only be dealt with by affecting what matters most to them money unfortunately office sociopaths who gaslight daily rarely get reprimanded they have everyone else in the office convinced they are wonderful and that you are the problem best solution is to remove yourself from that environment,negative
i swear i need this to deal with my whole family ,neutral
this puts a whole new perspective on the way i think about others actions and my reactions i cant change people but i can change the way i think and feel and also asking questions is another good point very well said,positive

my mother used my “successes” as her gauge to show approval and basic humanity it was never enough for her to show love only maybe enough to prevent the threats of leaving or avoid hearing that i was a complete failure take it from me don’t push your children towards your goals it only teaches them that they aren’t good enough to make it on their own i was “successful” in school and was the first in my family to get a degree but i was also the most miserable sad child of all 10 of us kids is that success i know it isn’t,negative

death game master there is 9999 chance that you will die cinema summary i like those odds,neutral
wouldn’t it be epic if cinema summary made his own death game ,neutral
i would like to argue that declaring you quit the death game and that the girlfriend can save herself is perhaps the worst way to test the game master in that situation yes figuring out a way to determine why the game master is helping you is a good idea but if the only reason theyre helping you is because theyre impressed with your selflessnesswillingness to risk your life to save hersthey have a connection to the girlfriend then say goodbye to your main advantage in this game im not sure if there is a good way to definitively figure out their motivations in one declarationaction but you could run some tests over time to see which actions get rewarded and make more declarations as to your own motivations to see if that has any effect but make them less obvious and less likely to cause the game master to completely abandon you,neutral

for the platform game just have each person make a prolonged sound while slowly going and laying down on the platform that way you can easily tell if there’s a wall between you and them by whether the sound changes,neutral
2152 im pretty sure that wouldnt be enough to destroy his plan if lets say one of the three people with the wall managed to answer the question correctly thats still 2 options eliminated and with how fast shirube came up with his first plan he had more than enough time to devise a second test to figure which of the remaining two directions was the correct one,neutral
for the platform game i think the second go was almost perfect if he found a way to obscure his hands and ask a loaded question then it would’ve been foolproof like if he kept a coin and hid it somewhere on his person then asked everyone which hand held the coin that’s not a perfect solution but that’s the kind of question i’m thinking of one where if you choose an obvious answer you know they’re lying and the only one telling the truth would give you a third answer,neutral
in the platform game what if the guy asked the other people to go to the corner of the edge of the platform and reach their hand out so he can grab it since theres only a small opening in the center they wouldnt be able to do it and the distance seems to be close enough for this to work,neutral
this guy’s definetly a genius,positive
for the spinning platform i have an easier solution once you see which way is safe to jump and they put the mask on put your hand on one of the corners of the platform while facing the safe area now when the platform rotates count how many turns it has made by feeling with your free hand the position of your hand on the corner being able to count how many rotations made gives you the idea of where you are and where to jump,neutral
as for the spinning jump game the voices from the people behind the wall will have less compare to the voice without the wall with that alone it will be very easy to figure out,neutral
summary 1 try obtain a consistent 78 hours sleep time per day 2 try match your schedule with your circadian rhythm dont force yourself to wake up early or stay up late 3 use a melodic alarm 4 dont snooze at all 5 physical exersice exposure to bright natural light during daytime 6 hydrate yourself 7 contain caffeine intake preferably avoid caffeine intake 6 hours before bedtime 8 eat healthily avoid eating before bedtime 9 regular exercise though avoid it before bedtime 10 napping before 3pm preferably with length of a complete sleep cycle 90m 11 warm shower before bedtime 12 avoid alcohol after evening 13 sleep in a dark cool environment 14 put away gadgets from bed 15 dont lie awake get up to do something and relax yourself 16 dont check time when youre awake midsleep 17 develop a healthy consistent sleep schedule 18 value yourself dont ignore your health or mental issue seek professional help if you need to,neutral
the best thing i started doing to wake up is to leave my phone on my desk across the room so i cant be on my phone before bed and i have to stand up to turn off my alarm just forcing myself to stand up in the morning stops me from snoozing my alarm,positive

i was constantly exhausted no matter how much i ate or slept it was affecting my job my workouts at the gym even my free time i felt terrible like i was sick or something i finally went to the doctor and found out i had an iron deficiency so my doctor put me on supplements and offered me an infusion and i feel so much better so its definitely worth getting bloodwork done and going to the doctors on top of all these great tips,positive
my thing has been the shifting of schedules to match my chronotype just the violence of waking up at 6h30 was unbearable for me and when i went to college and picked classes that started at 10 at the earliest it was a game changer i am not sleeping more hours maybe less hours even because college but i am never truly tired anymore,negative
the early bird and night owl thing totally makes sense people would have to take turns defending the tribe so different sleep schedules makes sense,neutral
i’m a nurse i work night shift but even working nights following these tips is so important for me some people think i’m crazy for staying on a night schedule even on my days off but it’s like you said it’s so hard on your body to not just stay on one schedule my blackout curtains sleep mask extended release melatonin are my best friends after a shift a hot shower,positive
there was one single semester in undergrad that i was able to set my schedule up so that everyday i had a class start at 1000 a regular lunch break and evening classes that ended by 6 and my dorm happened to be a single with a lot of windows and natural light having a consistent schedule that matched my night owl rhythm and light regulation was the best sleep i ever felt it was also the most consistent i’ve ever been in the gym since quitting high school sports followed by a semester where classes started at either 830 or 2pm on alternate days and my worst semester both grade and mentalhealth wise,positive
i have ptsd and clinical depression so i always feel tired ive been subjected to things i wouldnt wish on anyone and even that was way easier than trying to get out of bed is for me now please take care of yourselves treatment for depression is very effective dont worry about potential side effects because one very common side effect of depression is that you pass away,negative
great advice all of it im one of those you mentioned near then end with a medical condition sleep isnt rejuvenating for some no matter how much we get working towards good sleep habits is still helpful as it regulates our lives and helps us pace what minimal energy we have so if youre reading this comment no matter if youre chronically ill like i am or just a tired person without a debilitating illness practice good sleep habits be patient itll help,positive

realizing that no matter what happens ill be okay is exactly how i survived my childhood i used to stress so much then after so many dramatic plot twists i realized if i survived all that i will survive whatever else comes my way and thats when i stopped stressing as much i hadnt really connected it with confidence before but i can see the connection now interesting ,positive

practice keeping your word everyday you’ll really gain confidence every time you say you’re gonna do something and don’t do it your selfesteem diminishes no matter how meaningless the task may seem take your word very serious,neutral
one thing this video misses and probably the one most important thing is that confidence comes from within you can stand in any way you want dress as fancy as you like and have enough money to make king solomon blush but if inside you’re still insecure the world will see it love yourself know you’re worthy and never let the outside effect or diminish the inside don’t try and be or imitate someone else be who you are and love it one thing this video gets right know you’re gonna be ok no matter what ‘nough said love to you all xxx,positive
you reach true confidence by letting everything go,positive
if you spend time getting to know yourself and learn to love and accept that person then you strengthen the most important relationship of your life the one you have with yourself if that relationship is solid then you always have an inner safe haven no matter what is going on around you that self love and understanding allows you to stay true to yourself in every situation that is the deepest form of confidence,positive

hi just want to say that many times ruminating is emotionally driven… there can be an uncomfortable feeling and our mind jumps in to try to either make us feel better or dwell on that feeling and feed more into it so shifting from our mind and into our body sensations can actually be really helpful and grounding and even illuminating when we ignore our feelings our body often starts shouting at us to get our attention so just listening to what our body is saying acknowledging the feelings and fears can be very clarifying and soothing,neutral

one of my favorite cakes my mother ever made started out as a near fail it was a cheesecake that had cracked down the middle we had blueberries growing in our yard so she took a bunch that wed already picked cooked them down into a thick jelly and poured it into the crack as i recall she called it grand canyon blueberry cheesecake,positive
the pool cake was so cute put an appropriate toy depending on what character your child is currently obsessed with im 20 and i would still absolutely love to get a cake like that,positive
as soon as hyper realistic cakes came up my first thought was sideserf i love that you made sure to point out that she has problems with her videos being stolen and uncredited to spread the word to new audiences its why she uses the fluorescent green icing now i love watching all your content but it just mesmerises me when you bake 3,positive
just woke up at 6am nothing like an upload from ann to start off our fridays the effort you put into every single video you make is just chefs kiss easily the most informative and creative baking channel i know and it goes so far beyond that as youve shown time and time again,positive
the transformation of these cakes are mind blowing,positive
ann im so glad you stepped in to be the aussie mum the world needed have you ever thought about doing an episode on traditional australian bakes like lamingtons anzac biscuits pavlovas etc theyre good recipes for new bakers also maybe find an old cwa cookbook and follow the recipes especially when australia still had rations,positive

the movie explains how to kill him you need to make him be afraid you what ever he turns into you need to face that fear and fight back once pennywise realises that you arent scared he will begin to starve because he feeds off of fear once he starves and is weakened you can finish him off for good,negative
laughter defeats fear it would have made more sense in the remake if instead of bullying and insulting it they start laughing at how silly and not frightening the clown really is without any fear it gets weaker and weaker until it finally shrinks down to the bug it truly is,negative
so im watching this for nostalgia reasons i still love this series,positive
the reason why pennywise said fear when he was defeated is not because he will spread more of it its because he is feeling fear and he let go for 2 reasons so he can go down to his lair and because hes in shock,negative

the way that kid toss the chalk away when he finished writing is golden also a dragon fruit is the fruit of a cactus plant prickly pear is also another delicious one,positive
wife how many fingers will you use dad ill only use my thumb thumb,neutral
the duck going for a swim and the service dog pushing the wheelchair are the cutest things ive seen all day,positive
for those wondering the way how honey pot ants get their abdomens so big with fluids it done by feeding a freshly emerged adult ant tons of food while their exoskeleton is still soft this allows the gaster to stretch bigger than normal leading to how the ants become so plump they do this because if a shortage of food comes the other ants can get it from the ants that store it in their large abdomens called repletes it really is fascinating thing to see happen,positive
as the pinned comment already said i think this was one of your coolest videos it had a lot of weird but cool and fascinating clips i really enjoy watching your content,positive
the fruit from the cactus is actually pretty decent it’s been a few years since i’ve last tried it but sometimes it can be kinda tangy if i remember correctly,positive

“very little is needed to make a happy life it is all within yourself in your way of thinking” marcus aurelius meditations,positive
the biggest thing ive realized lately is that the more money you have the more money you will want to spend so you never really feel like you have enough thats why i really like the idea mentioned in this video of learning how to be satisfied with what you already have this is especially true of us in the first world we get carried away by envy and comparison and believe the lie that other people live happier lives than us because they have all this stuff that they are living the dream but the fact is that the only reason they have all this stuff is because they are stressed out all the time trying to maintain their excessive lifestyles and if they stopped pushing to get more and more stuff then they would realize that happiness was already within their reach the irony is that people in the third world that come to live in the first world have a tendency to become like this the most they have lived their whole lives in poverty feeling envy for those in the first world who have everything they need so when they come to live here and get a job they carry their envy with them and buy into the lie that they need more and more stuff their family back home wonder why they are so stingy in sending money but the family doesnt realize that the cost of living is much higher where we live you never feel like you have enough,positive
perfect video as always ez in todays day age every person needs to remove excess baggage from ones life and embrace the idea of simplification both sense and simplicity are the two most significant aspects of our lives,positive

that last point is really true its not about simplifying all aspects of life just for its own sake rather the point is for a more tranquil life thanks for the video,positive
i love your channel the technical details are perfect i’m an engineer and i work with batteries as a hobby there are two kinds of batteries that are lion one is “protected” and the other is “unprotected” the protected ones prevent overcharging and overdischarging as well as over current the unprotected ones do not and rely on external protection guess which people choose for their vaping lithium ion batteries have a huge energy density they are damaged by over charging and over discharging cheap chargers don’t behave and will over charge few if any vaping tools have protection for over discharge so why don’t people use protected cells generally those have too low current to make vaping possible the current draw to instantly heat to 200c is a lot of current and generally the protection on the cell would kick in causing things to not work or work much more slowly,positive

ive been vaping on and off for 5 years having my honorary internet mom sound slightly disappointed in me made me throw everything out and i havent touched anything since this video came out its been rough but thank you for making me take the first step in getting healthier,neutral
they removed the trust verification by removing the dislike number from being seen yes i get all the arguments of why they did it but people can watch a video to see if the dislike ratio is justified and read the comments to why the dislike was made its sort of like reading reviews on a product you are purchasing,negative
i remember when vaping was purely prescribed to recovering smokers 10 years ago my friends mother had a vape that looked exactly like a cigarette and was recommended to her by a proffesional now i see middle schoolers sharing them in the parking lot of the school,negative
there needs to be a trust rating the dislike button that got removed to protect smaller creators ,neutral
making a separate comment for this one thing you didnt mention in the exploding vape part of the video is counterfeit batteries you mentioned faulty batteries poorly designed vapes but i think this is a big one that should not be left out most people who vape seek out batteries from known reputable brands however theres a huge problem of cheap counterfeit imitations of those batteries being sold under the original brand name even on places like amazon amazon have a huge problem with counterfeit products being sold through their website and it has really tarnished their brand in many peoples eyes,negative
a shame how quickly vapes went from a better alternative to cigarettes to public heath hazard and under scrutiny,negative

i already am comfortable poaching an egg i even own egg laying chickens but i am so happy and excited to try this method you are absolutely right i have seen tons of poaching videos and this is a unique technique,positive
so wonderful cant wait to try some perfect poached eggs soon ,positive
ill remember this for the next time i host brunch for a large group there are tons of great tips in here to help get a lot of eggs on the table at the same time if youre only making three or four eggs this method seems like overkill i add a few tablespoons of vinegar to the simmering water and crack one egg at a time into a ramekin so that i can very gently add it to the water as long as the eggs are fresh it works every time,positive
incredible method after 10 years as a chef i thought i tried every way possible to poach eggs and this one is by far the best tried it this morning it works flawlessly 1010 thanks for this tip ,positive

summary notes 0000 intro the problem of information overload leads to a need for a system to help manage and organize information the second brain system helps solve the problem of information overload by providing a framework for organizing and storing information the second brain system has helped ali in his own life and can hopefully help others as well the second brain system uses code as an acronym to explain its core foundations capture organize distill express 0041 what is a second brain and why should you have one a second brain is a digital system for capturing and organizing ideas building a second brain can help you express your creativity be more productive and make better decisions every job today involves knowledge work of some kind and a second brain can help you with inputting processing and outputting information the methodology for building a second brain has four parts capture organize distill and express code 0456 c capture ali discusses different ways of capturing information both manually and automatically ali captures his thoughts and ideas in apple notes he also has a system for automatically capturing highlights from books articles and podcasts having a good capture system helps reduce stress levels by freeing up your brain from having to remember everything ali recommends using a note taking system to store thoughts and ideas that come to mind throughout the day as well as highlights from books articles and podcasts 0832 o organise ali suggests organizing information by actionability rather than topic in order to be more targeted and efficient in ones learning this means that when you come across something relevant you add it to the project folder related to the action you plan to take rather than creating a new category for it you can still search for specific information using control f or command f if needed this system is especially helpful when working on longterm projects with many moving parts 1107 d distill ali talks about a method called progressive summarization which is basically like highlighting but on steroids this is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important different than highlighting were used to in school its not particularly effective for retention in your own personal brain but it is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important 1145 e express the e in the second brain system stands for express meaning that once you have captured and organized your ideas you need to share them with the world in some way sharing your ideas allows you to receive feedback collaborate with others and ultimately create something tangible that is the output of all of your hard work without expressing our ideas they are essentially useless its important to find a way to share your creativity with others 1309 how my second brain has helped ali the coursebook has helped ali become more productive but also more creative and less stressed in general the system taught ali the idea of slow burns versus heavy lifts working on multiple projects simultaneously so that when it comes time to actually finish one most of the work is already done the system has also helped with his teaching work he can easily prepare talks with just a few minutes notice by referencing his stored information,positive

to absorb what one reads its crucial to master concentration when i started reading in my early youth my mind would wander before finishing a page over time my concentration improved to a point where i could read dozens of pages without losing my train of thought activities like chess reading and meditation are effective in improving concentration i know a buddhist monk who can clear his mind for long periods even when in a noisy environment its a skill that he developed over time with practice and discipline its literally rewired his brain schools fail miserably in teaching our youth in the art of self learning,positive
i was born into a relatively poor family never had the opportunity to go to college i became obsessed with the self learning technique right out of high school i happened to live in a town that had one of the top 10 business schools in the us i would go to the university library and pour over the text books in the order they were taught within 18 months i had the knowledge of an mba by the time i was 20 i started my own company and was a millionaire before i turned 40 it took so long because when a guy with no formal education walks into a bank for a loan they tend to want to laugh at you i finally found a banker that would talk to me i explained my business model and told him how the current inverted yield curve would effect the time value of the money i would borrow he was floored,positive
be a teacher but forever a student listening in itself is a lost art so difficult to run across a good listener joe rogan comes to mind i really enjoy the interviews he has conducted with elon as his guest i dont necessarily agree with elon on many things but he seems sincere and takes his time trying to explain his thoughts what i like about joe is he gives his guests time to speak without interrupting them with his own beliefs or agenda like so many on the tell a vision being a good listener takes practice but well worth the effort,positive
the most important thing for learning like musk says is understanding the fundamentals of whatever it is you want to understand always always always build a solid foundation and then everything else will make perfect sense,positive
i love elon he makes it cool to be smart hes a genius,positive

everybody you can take any variety of quinoa from the store meant to be cooked and plant the seeds i have done this in california many times and have grown several varieties of quinoa it takes a small field to get enough to sell but a few plants will give you a few cups of dried grain you can cook for a few meals and some seed to save for next year and the leaves are edible too and can be cooked like spinach the next time you go shopping at a store that sells quinoa plant a few of the grains you can even grow it as a houseplant but beware it grows several feet tall and wide and is prone to falling over when the flowers get heavy if you try to grow this plant just pause this video and look at the ground they are growing it in it likes to grow in a mixture of compacted dirt crumbled rock and sand in a very hot place where its occasionally watered thats what you wanna put in your flower pot and reproduce mine grew well in a place where there used to be a gravel walkway that had been overgrown with thistles and nothing else for years please grow your own quinoa even if just for fun it would be a cool school science project to do with kids the stuff is like a weed and grows in conditions other food sources do not,neutral

the video is great especially when you talk about the agency business model although i disagree about some other business models generalizations for example on affiliate marketing nobody says you get paid once its an option theres revenue sharing pay per sale etc from dropshipping you can also get recurring with monthly kits or other types of products that have a smaller life cycle costumer the margins game is highly variable and thats where some people get ahead of others nevertheless selling roi services for businesses is still great for beginners but in the future it would be wise to get traffic in other ways while also building a brand for your agency website content and all,positive

the ‘offer to work for free’ thing is surprisingly rare but great advice i took a gamble and emailed a company i covered in my psychology bsc to ask if i could come work for them for free and they gave me a paid gig as a trial 16 years later and i’m now managing director in all those years not one person has attempted the same thing,positive

look man you folks have changed my life ive been struggling to make my design business profitable for almost a decade and because i couldnt figure it out myself ive been being employed by companies that dont serve me or my wallet ive been living short of my purpose and i knew it i have been watching this channel for 3 weeks and i have already started networking smarter charging more being more aggressive with my design style and approach i feel confident and you chris do have given me that as a creative i dont know if ill ever be able to thank yourepay you but know that you changed a mans life with what you know thank you so much and keep building the future,positive
this was amazing thank you chris love the emphasis on value and that the buyer determines it i learned not to waste time trying to convince someone to see value you can help them realize the value but you can’t force them to change what they value that’s a losing game,positive
so glad this made it to chris desired metric im only 15 minutes in and have received massive value from this thank you so much chris i am still in the beginning stages of getting my photovideo portfolio ready but this massively changes how i think about pricing and will be extremely beneficial when i start to take on paid work,positive

i watch elon musk videos to grow back the neurons i lost throughout the day looking at memes,positive
“starting a company is like eating glass and staring into the abyss” having started 2 small corner stores myself this quote is very true,neutral
for sure the reality business is hard and painful and takes a huge amount of effort if you want to build something great the best quote i heard was nobody is expecting you to do something amazing but it is amazing when you do something the reality is you might not build a multi billion dollar business that is global but you might build something that brings value and that is why we get into business to test ourselves our own ability and to be different you can only admire what elon musk has achieved and the potential of where technology could take us in the future,positive
me came here for business ideas elon musk neurological computers genetics and electric aircraft me guess ill stick to selling things on ebay,neutral
i already lost a lot of money recently trying to pursuit my dreams its frustrating and depressing but elon definitely gives me hope and determination he is a role model for me,positive
great video but let me talk about something important i see many young and old make mistakes that i think should not be i believe that everyone young or old should have an investment plan that increases their financial returns from three figures to six figures the investment can be your retirement plan or future plan depending on what you want but what matters most is that you have an investment that is profitable,positive
its touching to hear elon talk about wanting to bridge a gap between the genetically unfortunate with intelligence augmentation my mother has a hereditary severe brain disease that affected her life disabled her the impact of her brain health affected my developmentlife and my brain health the genetic component also affected my brain health currently im functionally disabled from it too its a constant chronic hell cycle its comforting to know someone out there as dedicated and capable as elon musk is thinking about disadvantaged people like my mother i,neutral
if your customers love you your odds of success are dramatically higher great stuff,positive
at 224 elon says something quite profound entrepreneurs are born of everyday this resonates with me because the next big entrepreneurs are likely to be ordinary people with an innovative idea and a solution to a problem that people face everyday they are problem solvers its quite exciting to see fresh new ideas come to market and people starting new businesses,positive

it makes sense btc and crypto is off helping to regulate rather than pretend it wont ever happen the big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into the stratosphere most people dont like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize the projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space i’d get involved more knowing that i have made over 7 btc and 15eth from daytrade with leroy davids crypto in few weeks,neutral
as you can see we are already in august and i feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just naïve the sphere have seen far worse times than this enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions id say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding trading went smooth for me as i was able to raise over 92 btc when i started at 35 btc in just few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from liberton corp would advise y’all to trade your asset rather than hold for a future you arent sure about,positive
although i have interests in global economics i dont watch the news anymore i have enough fud thanks for this news and offering your insight on how to navigate during unfortunate timesevents like this youre right about keeping level headed when investing so thats why i think its important to limit the amount of fud we consume i dont watch the media but the news that you present has enough to know issues going on without riding the emotional rollercoaster if i were to watch the news everyday now i buy and just trade long term more than ever i have made over £728k from day trading with liberton corp signal in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish,neutral
libertoncorp is young holding almost anything mentioned here is a good hold because the vhs or beta will only show in time i want to hold them early its sad that most dont think of these things as good future holds instead of being out of the market and bottom hunting are we the adopters or are we scavengers surely one of these layer ones will become the standard and i dont want to sell any of them too early,neutral
i sincerely appreciate the work youve done and the knowledge you share technical analysis can be helpful but i think it is quite puzzling that wellknown cryptocurrency youtubers just pay attention to pure ta and entirely ignore the bigger narrative of why btc is inflating and why the outlook for the future is even more encouraging than it seems ignoring the reality that each etf launch to this point has caused a sizable decline from btc highs is somewhat dangerous we were already in a perilous position and only survived a protracted bear market due to historically low volume and nearly whale pumps day trading should be given greater consideration because it is less affected by the markets situation trading daily with libertoncorp i have earned over 12btc using his insights and charts his insight has always been a step ahead of others,neutral

keep up the great work you are truly an asset to the community thanks for all you do i like your truthful coverage btcs price has been fluctuating lately buying isnt a tough call but it is a very tough call to figure out what to do aside holding the good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable most people do not understand how the space works your advantage in understanding chart wont guarantee what an asset is going to do prices will go up or down nevertheless the market has been so profitable despite price ups and down ive always played safe implementing trades with insights and signals from a renowned trader libertoncorp i made 12btc from this recent crash and despite the ups and down in the market i’m still bagging more money,positive
honestly i appreciate you and your content technical analysis is good but i find it truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure ta and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why btc is pumpspumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems its kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each etf launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of btc we were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumpsnarrowly avoiding a longterm bear market more emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market i have made over 35 btc from day tradng with liberton corp insights and charts his been one step ahead of other analysisstick with btcethbnbadamatic,negative

high fashion is sometimes very abstract very elitist very bizarre and sometimes purely ridiculous but if you push all of the crazy price tags aside and all the ridiculous celebrity endorsers too you find artisans people who study and excel in a craft they deserve to be highlighted more behind that overpriced chanel bag is a leatherchainfabric artisan and years of creative thought and passion fast fashion is slowly killing our planet water consumption landfills toxic chemical dumped in village waters people paid pennies etc haute couture is rare it’s scarce i find the luxury scene beyond ridiculous but i love my high end pieces that have lasted me years and will continue to do so behind these fashion shows are artisans that will always be better than any fast producing machine,negative

luxury fashion is one of the worlds biggest industries i think this is a great topic for a bloomberg series i would be interested is seeing more of this type of content i am particularly interested in the recent collaboration between gucci and balenciaga especially now that i know they both come under the kering umbrella other recent collaborations include versace and fendi which could be the subject of another video the more recent video in this series examines the chinese market and how fashion brands are now targeting young asian consumers,positive
the worst thing to happen to fashion was ‘influencers’ who encourage always wanting the next instead of appreciating the now and the classic they’re so fickle and encourage everyone else to be the same,negative
i love how “luxury” is about preserving the craft and labor of the poor for the rich like what really is the point here is it the small artisans who get and praise or the fashion “houses” and companies that actually get to design exploit labor and sell for profit  the definition just isn’t strong enough for me to care,negative
i used to love high fashion but the more i learn about what goes on in the industry the more i feel like pursuing a different career choice so much nepotism elitism and lack of creativity it’s almost as if you don’t fit within certain enclaves you’re not welcomed,negative
i love the new sustainability efforts excited to see new changes,positive
people are really stuck on the price tags and not understanding that couture is only made to order by experts in their fields thats what this video is looking at these pieces are art and art is different for everyone just because you dont like this version of art doesnt make you better than those who do i could never afford these pieces but that doesnt stop me from really appreciating the vision behind it,neutral
what annoys me the most is that these so called a majority of these high class fashion brands exploit their workers with long hours and little pay even though they are selling products for an extremely high price tag,negative
i switched years ago from fashion to reupholstery so glad i get to reduce reuse upcycle last of a dying breed 2 of the world do what we still do,positive

i always enjoyed selling this product as a fishmonger it was something my guest looked forward to and i was happy to sell it rly is top tier fish and some i do quite respect,positive
so glad kyle brought up how important salmon are for native alaskan communities,positive
wish kyle and his crew all the luck to always bring home king salmon every time they go out to fish for it,positive
i was lucky to have copper river salmon once it was by far the best salmon i’ve ever tasted,positive
im really glad he acknowledged the indigenous traditions and food culture there are a lot of fishermen that dont care about preservation or morals,positive
its fascinating that a gill netted fish in an estuary not at the peak of their growth cycle garners so much money when compared to troll caught kings on hook and line when theyre still putting on fat that are treated immediately to ike jima processed individually and then hand packed on ice to get core temps down immediately,positive
i am happy for this dude he seem happy and humble i wish him nothing but luck,positive

thanks for having me on the stream hamza i wish i said more and i wish i was more clear with my words but i was nervous anyways i rewatched the chat and had a good laugh saw a lot of toxicity and criticism but all is welcome the chat was really funny and any criticism i got i deserved thanks again hamza this was an awesome opportunity to talk to you even if we didn’t talk mainly about the subject we were supposed to enjoy life,positive

i remember watching a documentary about how the area of west africa had become a dumping ground for usedunwanted clothes from europe and the americas more specifically the north americas i was totally shocked and had no idea about this villagers would sometimes travel for several miles on foot sometimes with their kids to pick through this clothing waste to sell into their communities and earn money most of it just became literal mountains of clothes on the beaches and wherever,negative
i have yet to make a return to amazon that wasn’t damaged double shipped or not as described they could avoid a lot of returns by better vetting i also often select returned items if the saving are worth it so far no problems,positive
this is one of the coolest things ive noticed recently when ollies popped up in my hometown selling namebrand goods at a quarter of the original pricei knew liquidation stores would be the way of the future i love it it makes me happy seeing these goods find homes instead of ending up as pollution,positive
as a person who shops on the clearance aisles at stores im loving this documentary its an industry not many people think of on a large scale but definitely very profitable,positive
the only issue is that the majority of customers are resellers so most consumers aren’t getting the discount but either way it helps the environment which is great,positive
it’s buyer behavior it goes beyond buying up multiple sizes to see what fits i’ve sold on ebay for years with no issue same individual item again and again one year i sold on amazon and i was blown away by the types of buyers i had many requested a cancellation of purchase which i gladly did i don’t want to have to pay for return shipping due to a mistake the buyer made many also requested a return claiming the item was defective but when i paid for the item to be shipped back to me due to amazons return policies the item would be returned in perfect working condition i don’t know if people are buying suggested items without thinking or assuming they’ll get something free if they complain but i can’t imagine the horror if i had to trash every single return i got sometimes after paying for the return shipping label the buyer would never ship all they had to do was print off the label and schedule a pickup but the act of deciding to keep it without any further communication beyond return approval makes me believe they were after a freebie,neutral

here i am employed as a developer watching a video that purports to be for beginners and its a great video so far one of the things i love about approaches like this is that especially for developers like me who just picked up some crap over time and am doing stuff with it there are lots of fundamentals that slip through those autodidactic cracks for instance i know what statelessness means generally but then at around 2330 craig explains not only clearly but completely enough for the contextwith no extraneous details nice work,positive
you guys make learning fun the fact that you went over apis in a broad sense and not just webbased really nailed home what an api really is wow,positive
im enjoying your tutorial a lot but a side note i think its recommended to invoke pip as python m pip because it is more portable having recently had issues due to windows10 and trying naively to just invoke pip on its own i thought it would be worth mentioning especially since this is aimed at beginners who might struggle with issues like that cheers,positive
this was truly a whirlwind introduction to apis i believe it was a little more harder for me as i havent started to learn java yet still learning python but none less this is an extremely well done course thank you craig for your work and i will now take another rest as ive reached the end to unscramble my brain,positive
this is easily the best course in this section hats of to this guy didnt feel like boring bombarment of information enjoyed every moment of it,positive

while it is a good idea to seamlessly blend tutorial and initial gameplay i still have a soft spot for stuff like the hazard course in halflife which is an inuniverse training grounds for people to get familiar with the hev suit and in turn the game and its mechanics,positive
honestly i feel like the most important option with a tutorial is the option to skip it entirely for replaying purposes and the option to revisit it at any point in the game,positive
one of my friends gave up on monster hunter rise because he got overwhelmed by all the mechanics you can interact while having pretty much 0 tutorials especially how weapons work and which are their movesets as a veteran i really no longer think about that but it reminded me how not having gradual introductions to the main mechanics of a game can turn many potential players away,negative

the minecraft way step 1 build a temporary box house or cave home step 2 after playing for awhile and gathering materials prepare to build your new house step 3 look up some builds people have done for their houses for inspiration step 4 realize that to accomplish any of those youll need to get 10x the resources you already have and spend like 10 hours of dedicated building time step 5 stop playing for 8 months step 6 start playing again but feel completely lost and confused as to wtf you were doing step 7 decide to start a new world so you can just start from the start instead of trying to remember everything from your current world step 8 return to step 1,negative

just wanna real quick say that if you plan on being really good at building this is not the only tutorial you need not even remotely being an expert at building requires near perfect understanding of the basics ie what they are and how to execute them you need to understand most if not all of the simple concepts there are have a huge amount of tricks and ideas saved up for detailing and really anything for that matter often times even understand things like color theory there is way too much to becoming a good builder to fit into a single video especially an 8 minute one but as far as guidelines for people who just want a nice house this video is great pretty much everything is spot on and will make things look good almost every time you build it also if you want to get really into building i would recommend watching all of grians tutorials and once youve gotten to a decently advanced level watching tutorials from another far smaller youtuber who goes by horace minecraft he is an amazing content creator and is incredibly talented in his craft in my opinion even better than grian is though they do build in vastly different ways so there isnt much comparison that works there,neutral

what are your thoughts on being an energy independent nation what are your thoughts on nuclear energy  wbf university join my school here ⮕,neutral
the two major nuclear disasters happened because of 1 incompetence chernobyl and 2 natural disaster fukushima as a british citizen i would say that on the most part we are very capable of preventing those two things we’ve wasted 30 years of nuclear understanding and fine tuning in my opinion let’s get those plants running baby,negative
i think anyone who has spent time working in a modern agile corporate environment could tell you the crux of the problem in an instant we no longer plan past the next quarter supply chain bottleneck is just another way of saying that we let the beancounters run the show and they were good at it right until something happened which they could neither model nor predict cerveza the system is brittle by design because its so much cheaper that way nuclear energy runs counter to this business ethos its a huge engineering lift it takes 20 years to pay itself off you need a trained workforce with domestic production and fabrication capacity that can forge the parts machine them weld them then certify and maintain them over a period of 40 years instead weve been gleefully shutting profitable factories at home gutting workforces funneling everyone into college resulting in massive brain drain skill loss as the old timers machinists retire but hey we delivered a lot of value for shareholders and now the chickens are coming home to roost,negative
germany acted foolishly when decommissioning so much nuclear when it was providing so much clean energy their co2 emissions would likely be much lower if they kept them around plus they would have more energy independence personally i am a big fan of nuclear as it provides the kind of reliable concentrated energy production that fossil fuel based systems offer but without the emissions renewables require so much land and raw materials and produce relatively small amounts of energy compared to nuclearfossil fuels i would far rather have a nuclear power plants replace existing coal and gas plants using the same small plots of land with renewable it requires covering vast amounts of land with solarwind in order to collect the highly defuse energy source that is windsolar this land should be used for farming or nature preserves not renewables if the solar is using worthless land such as the desert maybe it makes senses but that has its own problems of longer transmission lines and more frequent cleaningmaintenance needed due to the dust offshore wind also resolves the land use problem but the costs of maintaining 100s of windmills in the extremely harsh ocean environment are very high not to mention ruining the view of ocean front properties,neutral
this was known by literally every nation in the world if youre dependent on other nations you are subject to their whims most important of all is food and energy independence looks at eu moves to remove food independence as well hmm you know when you remove others independence you are supposed to make them dependent on you you arent supposed to weaken yourself,neutral
nuclear is a great carbonfree base load electricity source i’d like to see it not as a competition but rather a companion to renewables in the future electrical generation portfolio on the downside nuclear is expensive to build and insure but the actual watts generated are among the cheapest there are also concerns about the total available uranium to run the reactors and it seems like we’ll have enough of it for 50100 years if we generate 4050 of the energy from nuclear on top of that thorium reactors could be a viable alternative to their uranium counterparts another new direction in nuclear is small modular reactors 4th gen which in theory should be much cheaper to build and run making initial investment lower they would also give us greater agility in planning the electrical grid,neutral
so impressed marko has made a video regarding energy use in the eu it is useful to view the data from just a futures point of view which is how companies plan on future availability way to keep up the good work marko btw nuclear energy has been overlooked for the last 30 years and needs to come back it is sad how german and french embraced nuclear energy then pulled back which leaves them open to the crisis now america should take heed,neutral
excellent video marko things look really bad for now just recently it was reported that germans among many others probably already spend their savings to fight inflation instead of having their salaries rise to cover it i dont want to imagine what will happen in the winter when the energy bills will really increase or when those savings run out,negative
great video again marko you did a great job  sadly the netherlands was not in your list as a viewer or replied on your videos  in addition i can tell that after the fukushima nuclear incident in march 2011 the eu banned nuclear power plants due to risk of a second chernobyl incident the thru regulations coal was stamped as dirty and gas was the second best option after nuclear power if we go back into history the north european countries the netherlands also build the infrastructure for gas pipes in cities and villages since there wasnt a need to change and gas was promoted after 2011 the perfect storm was created now there is need so the coal and nuclear power plants are being restarted to for fill the energy need from my point of view these things should change nuclear is the way to go create a military security perimeter around nuclear power plants the western world shouldnt be working with russia nor china for energy or any productions due to the believe differences and reliability furthermore the ecb cant loosen any monetary policy because there is nothing to stimulate with 0 intrest rates the financial unstable countries you call them pigs portugal italy greece spain and with this structural inflation problems russia knows this and the ecb messed up big time last but not least the eu but also the usa canada australia and japan need to stop applying qe start paying debts and slowly deflate for the upcoming 5 to 10 years if not this system will implode and nothing will be affordable thanks again marko,positive
hi marko im living in the germany not born though and have been following your podcast because you do good analysis honestly as a european i feel quite disappointed by everything i understand why the administration decided not to invest in nuclear energy after fukushima accident but on the other hand i cannot understand how they didnt invest in other resources or should i say how the europe especially germany didnt diversify when it comes to energy suppliers its like you said they just ignored that fact even though we already had a couple of years ago possible no delivery situation with russia,negative

freeing your mind from consumerism is so important were literally trained from young to always want more to never be satisfied to compare ourselves to our neighbors and what they have i was always a natural saver but struggled a bit in not comparing myself to others its still something i work on but over time have gotten better it definitely helped that i realized the image others put forward the majority of the time is financed by debt thats not something im interested in at all i hope more people learn this concept and actively practice it ill definitely talk about it on my channel as well,positive

funny enough the argument that bitboys business is advice is incredibly dangerous for him coming from someone who is actually registered to give financial advice there is a lot of regulation around who can give financial advice and what you can say if thats your business needless to say bitboy has probably violated a few rules on that front normally youtubers are protected from liability because their business youtube technically isnt advicebased admitting your business is advicebased though might open you up to liability im not a lawyer but i know a bit about the legality of financial advice happy to touch base if it would help,negative

hey erling paralegal here i saw the end of your video but would still recommend getting an attorney to help with handling this suit lawsuits are not fun in any way unless your the attorneyfirm and they cause an unimaginable amount of stress my parents were victim of a certain suit and it really followed them everywhere and lingered in the back of their minds always moreover if the other side has an attorney they have the advantage of knowing how the system works such as what needs to be exchanged during the discovery phase rule 26a dislcosures interrogatories evidence you intend to use at trial depositions of plaintiffs defendants and expert witnesses etc and when to make appearances for compliance meetings with the judge i truly admire your resolve to stand your ground and defend yourself just be careful with how you proceed pay attention to deadlines and what needs to be done also remember its a legal system and not a justice system this is not legal advice just a concerned fan lawyers or other legal professionals please correct anything i may have overlookedunintentionally misconstrued ps i think the service the guy who threw the papers at you rudely was fine unfortunately you identified yourself once that happens they can just leave it at your doorstep,negative

amazing to see you supporting atozy looks like hes having a real tough time with it,positive
some people are just too sue happy hurt feelings from people stating opinions dont count bro he definitely stepped wrong on this because now someone like me who has zero interest in crypto because of excessive cynicism knows about him and knows to steer clear he did this not atozy or coffeezilla he put his reputation on the line instead of ignoring it and letting it roll off his back,negative
he always sues everyone hes a well known scammer who gets paid to promote crypto scams hes got a reputation,negative
can’t wait seeing him under oath asked how much money he’s taken to promote scams he’s digging his own grave on this one,negative

i appreciate the content you put out on youtube i enjoy watching your videos i respect you for applying your experience and knowledge into an investment decision and putting your neck on the line by making it public you may be right on this trade but if you are right you better also short the us market as well because if the chinese market collapses it will pull down the us market with it thanks buddy previously bitcoin has been fluctuating between the 20k and 25k price marks billions of dollars have been wiped off due to the crash in its price particularly in the last four weeks the loss has become the primary cause of several firms’ liquidation issues in the crypto industry i think the direction is upward movement with a bit of silence before the storm agree its boring for the past few days a good strategy for hoddlerss moving forward would be to buy now and not get too excited to sell off with the upturn the rise will surprise everyone as for traders you make money anyways in both directions so just befriend the trend and use marketspotter to make informed decisions if you’re a modern investor then your main aim i guess would be to take home profits for yourself and family especially during times like this when reading the charts are extremely difficult due to its chronic volatility well goodnews you don’t have to worry about how this will come about just commit your investments with mrs robin moore and the rest will be a good history of profits for you i have been able to day trade my bitcoin to atop 1703 btc with 507 btc with her trade signal despite the state of the market her trade signal yield a lot of dividend only if you are paying attention to her instructions the good thing of this strategy is that whatever happens we have an opportunity to make some money trading with it not minding the sideways in the crypto market for helpguidance on buildinginvestingfinancial portfolio ͳeiєɠɾαm moorerobin,positive

i watch your videos for your real talks and you never disappoint keep going youve reminded me of what someone once said the mind is the man the poor is in it and the rich is it too this sentence is the secret of most successful investors i once attended similar and ever since then i have been waxing strong financially and i most tell you the truth the bulls have been in control of the market for more than a month they have managed to push the price by more than 100 the majority of this rally has been without a considerable correction begging the question if one is pending following the test of the critical 2k level one thing is certain nobody knows what is going on our leadership in the country couldn’t be any worse from the press to the feds they are all terrible they say you can’t time the market but this one was easy to see coming every man woman and child no matter the age needs financial assistance doesn’t matter if your young or old we all need the stimulus check checks asap thats the major reason why one have to invest in crypto but not only investing rather invest and trade your assets for the gains its unfair on how things have turned up to be due to inflation things has been so difficult but btceth trading has helped me maintain financial stability although i believe that the benefits of successful trading come from an expert and that is why i made huge profits with the help of mr james wilson he is a genius and that is why i always advise beginnersinvestors to trade with professionals like him so far i have been able to increase my crypto trading portfolio from day trading from 107 btc to atop 1301 btc with the accurate trading signal provided to me by james and im an attestant to the accuracy of his trading strategy you all in search of a way to recover your looses from the crash and accumulate more profits can reach out to him for mentorship and profitable trading system on ͳeiєɠɾαm jameswilson21 cheers thank me later,positive

i think the difference in this instance is that analyst’s are stating that we are heading for a depression so this changes everything in the grand scheme of things when talking about possible new ath’s great points in your video i agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think btc is perfectly correlated to spnasdaq and altcoins to btc refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective so many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom that short term thinking is such a rookie mistake by dollar cost averaging and holding for several years it takes the guess work out next bull run it wont be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k what will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low im really holding on for this possible low point reentry i screwed up some time back i need this lower point to get back in ive small cash on the sideline i dont like that but i refuse to fomo in our younger investors are scared theyre concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before my advise to them is this go all out into trading trading is where the bucks are been made i see the stock market housing values going down and crypto going up traditional markets are getting recked the new economy is crypto not fiat people want truth not corruption contracts not monetary easing venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment advisor mrs robin moore with her guides and trade signal i use in trading i have moved from having 58 btc to atop 173 btc in a short period of time invest today and trade your crypto assets with the best tutor trader ͳeiєɠɾαm moorerobin or whatsapp 12132627458 for more info or mentorship on how to invest trade and earn with her top notch trade signal,neutral
high inflation was never a reason to sellthe definition of inflation is that prices go up versus fiat essentially logically that would make sense even for stocks but especially for a commodity thats been known for many years as an inflation hedge my growing love for crypto caused me to explore until i came across alice marcella although im trying to avoid sensationalism alice is by far the best no hype for hypes sake but great inspiration to trade crypto the market has been irrational for far too long what were seeing today is a small correction of the illogical selling pressure,positive

finland does not have gas storage because it is not dependent on nat gas for energy in fact currently finland does not import any gas from russia and it is not a problem the situation in germany on the other hand is completely different as there 50 of households warm with russian gas,neutral
i live in the netherlands europe and got news for you we are already in an energy crisis gas price has gone 12x at the moment compared to prices pre covid that translates in 4x the price if you need a nrw energy contract so people here pay easy 600 a month instead of 150 euro but in 2023 prices are expected 800 to 1000 euros a month that means an insane recession you think the bearmarket is almost over think againit only just started,negative
in my younger years i guided flyfishing in alaska when looking out the window of the float plane sometimes i’d see ponds that almost looked like they were boiling it was natural gas coming up through the permafrost the arctic regions of europe have these same stores of natural gas they need to utilized as a measure of self sufficiency energy independent and security the idea they haven’t thought of this is crazy to rely on countries that harbor governments that brutalize their own citizens is not good business did you turn your back on the bully at school smiling and being nice is one thing but being in bed with evil is another,negative

first got into btc back in 2016 and have been hodlingbuying assets at different price points since ive been through corrections before and will likely experience more over the future volatility is simply the price one needs to pay if they want to play i dont have any alts as im a bit of a btc maxi but that said if btc hasnt died before it surely wont do so now stick in there yes we are all feeling the pain but over the long run this will just be a blip this is how i see past corrections when i felt that i got in at a high back then i think it was less than 1000 and bouncing all over the place now when i look back all i see is regret for not having the courage in buying more at those times but if you believe btc has value then by all means buy the dips if you can afford to for those who got in at 60 or 70k and feeling the crunch hang in there btc is not a get rich quick scheme wait it out and you will see you will come away stronger i buy and just trade long term more than ever i have made over 11 btc with 31btc in just 5weeks from day trading with wtrade inspects in few weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish,neutral

honestly i appreciate you and your content technical analysis is good but i find it truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure ta and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why btc is pumpspumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems its kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each etf launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of btc we were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumpsnarrowly avoiding a longterm bear market more emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market i have made over 12 btc from day tradng with wtrade inspects insights and charts they been one step ahead of other analysis,negative

i totally agree with what you are sayingthe fact is btc is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now if this is right time to invest before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first for the past few days the price of btc has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose others are being patient it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals i would say trading has been going smoothly for me i started with 25 btc and i have accumulated over 116 btc in just three weeks with the trading strategy given to me by wtrade inspects,neutral

i must say that you are the most erudite and smart analyst in the crypto space first of all youre just awesome ive been following for months now and the cinematic videos excellent insight and comedic tone are outstanding before anything else i would like to say that no one can exactly predict in days how long a bear or bull market could last or how low and high the prices can go but we can try to make predictions using past events i think prices should run up a lot now punishing panic sellers and forced sellers most new traders struggle at first to make sense of the markets and how to put their portfolios in a position to flourish many try to start on their own and quickly end up with a string of losses slowly seeing their accounts dwindle to what they started off as everyone is looking at the bitcoin price action from a 2021 bull run perspective everything has changed…we are in a recession facing stagflation rising rates and energy shortages driving food and living costs through the roof breaking consumers’ backs there are different strategies to profit from the crypto market but holding and waiting for a major pump is not the best way to earn profits off the market smart investors trade and take shortterm profits ive made over 11’ btc with 21’ btc retail trading not on my own but with the help of a professional who has reputable background and understanding of the market kyle miller i came across his channel where he shares his charts the selling fatigue will wane and the market will reset historically fortune favored the ones who bought in thought moments in moments of uncertainty when prices traded close to the 200wmayou can reach mr kyle on ͳeiєɠɾαm kylemiller3 cheers thank me later,positive

as the crypto market pauses with the stock market i take a deep look into the elliott wave theory count for the dow jones a requirement for bitcoin throughout all of its history has been that the stock market is rising int his video i attempt to do the elliot wave count for the stock market to see if it favors more upside along with discussing the psychology of each wave to see if that matches the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market right now below are products and services that i personally use and spend my own money on itrustcapital – cryptocurrency retirement ira’s are here and i can trade within my ira and have nontaxable events get 100 credited to your account when you sign up and fund your account through my link a special deal worked out for viewers of the bcb channel and itrustcapital tradingview – the technical analysis charting software i use in every video utilizing all the tips and tricks best practices complete analysis of the cryptocurrency market and exit plans get up to 30 off your subscription when you sign up through this link linqto –private equity investing in companies prior to having their ipo they offer popular companies like ripple unstoppable domains – own a crypto domain and tie multiple crypto addresses and wallets to one simple human readable name like mine bcbackercrypto where you can send me xrp btc eth ada and more by using that one simple address ledger nano – get your crypto off of the exchanges and into your own possession with a cold storage wallet hi i am the blockchain backer bringing you the latest cryptocurrency news and analysis the content of my channel primarily focuses on crypto news motivation and chart analysis on the xrp chart bitcoin chart various altcoin charts and market cap charts to support my channel and become a backer hodler or whale here on youtube here is the link disclaimer i am not a financial adviser investing and trading is risky and you can lose your money the information in this video should not be used to make any investment decisions you should contact a licensed financial adviser prior to making any investment decisions any affiliate links in the description of these videos may provide a commission if you decide to purchase their products i appreciate any and all support of my channel and without you i wouldnt be here thank you,neutral

i love how you do focus on more than just crypto two quick questions if we do start wave 5 any guess as to roughly what the peak would be is that the overall 4236 extension second what happens next if it hits that overall high i expect a crash but what if wave 5 doesnt get that high,positive
blockchain backer in the senario you describe are you expecting all time highs for alts or are you expecting to just take some money out when it goes up a bit more during wave 5,neutral
awesome video bcb thank you but what does wave 5 in the stock market mean for the alt coin market would we have enough time for eth to finish that fractal you mentioned the beginning of the super cycle also the merge is coming in a few weeks is bitcoin going up to 40k considered a retracement that we need for the alt coin season we all want,positive
what i love about you is that you never speak your bias as gospel you give everyone the freedom to decide for themselves without shoving your bias down their throats and potentially brainwashing them to think what you think you present each argument clearly and concisely i particularly love the breakdown explanation of elliot wave theory and what actually happens psychologically with the market participants well done brother have a good one ,positive

bonuses for failing companies is super common this doesnt make the practice of giving huge bonuses off the back of their creditors right its just weird that its in the news now because theyve been doing this for decades,negative
i would think some of that is probably due to the fact that it is a per transaction fee and while institutional investors have larger transactions retail has a higher amount of them,neutral
the amount on exchanges seemed like it represented an absolute amount… but given problems odyction of btc through mining increased this amount the real measure should be the percent of btc remaining on exchanges,neutral

i think the difference in this instance is that analysts are stating that we are heading for a depression so this changes everything in the grand scheme of things when talking about possible new aths great points in your video i agree and suspect it may be too convenient to think btc is perfectly correlated to spnasdaq and altcoins to btc refreshing to hear reasonable market analysis that takes a bigger picture perspective so many people are squabbling over timing the exact bottom that shortterm thinking is such a rookie mistake by dollar cost averaging and holding for several years it takes the guesswork out next bull runs it wont be a huge deal if we bought at 21k or 17k what will matter is that we are accumulating while the price is relatively low im really holding on for this possible low point reentry i screwed up some time back i need this lower point to get back in i’ve small cash on the sideline i dont like that but i refuse to fomo in our younger investors are scared theyre concerned about what they should do because a lot of them have not been through this before my advice to them is this go all out into trading trading is where the bucks are been made i see the stock market housing values going down and crypto going up traditional markets are getting recked the new economy is crypto not fiat people want truth not corruption contracts not monetary easing venturing into crypto trading investment has been a turning point for me with the help and tutoring from my investment advisor mrkyle miller with his guides and the trade signal i use in trading i have moved from having 58 btc to atop 173 btc in a short period of time invest today and trade your crypto assets with the best tutor trader ͳeiєɠɾαm kylemiller3 for more info or mentorship on how to invest trade and earn with his topnotch trade signal,positive

the daily btc trading volume is already way higher than the total cap release amount of btc by gox also not all coins will be release simultanious and there still is no hard date when it will happen plus not every creditor will sell it instantaneously and everything most obviously in short and in my humble opinion the price effect will be a drop in the ocean and nothing to worry about for btc holders especially in the long run when more and more people learn that leaving your coins out of exchanges eventually lead to continuation of upward price movement if sd stay equal and macro eff into acount,neutral

probably what they know is that prices for all cryptos are incredibly low right now and its a great time to buy instead of being filled with angst and fear they are showing a little courage and going ahead and stacking up their bags at a time when it makes a lot of sense to do so i think people need to stop being so fearful now is the time to buy that should be pretty clear by now anyone whos shorting and selling and worrying about whether the bottom is in etc doesnt really know what theyre doing,neutral

thanks for the update i always appreciate the insight im really blown away by the fact that having watched your videos for so long i had the same opinion that you are putting forth in this video in as much i would like to add to what you have said here the market is in a tug of war with the bull at one side and the bears at the other end if this is really a bear market rally then bitcoin is not done going down just like stocks are not done going down and if this isn’t a bear market rally and the fed achieves a soft landing bitcoin will probably rally substantially from where it is now but we just have to wait and see my hope is that by the fourth quarter the economy will be slowing enough that the fed says we are going to pause and then you will see the next crypto cycle start i have witnessed the last 3 cycles and just before each bull run the amount of bear posts and negativity around crypto is just like it is now bitcoin is entering the area of where a bottom will be formed imo please note this could take months and there will likely be further volatility in both directions despite the volatility that has ruled the market this year being a retail trader in the crypto market and implementing strategiessignals from eddie crypto a professional brokertradr that has been my mentor i have accumulated 12 btc in profits although the rates are capricious wiping out some of my profits people who are open to learning from history will survive it’s not that difficult you can reach out to mr eddie on ͳeiєɠɾαm his personal handle is edcrypto8 or whatsapp✙18053284321‬,positive

3417 do you see it the big edge pieces which everything turns around are actually the centers the cloverleaves are actually the edges and for the corners half of them look like centers and the other half are actually hidden inside the puzzle this means you actually have to look on the inside of the puzzle to see if those pieces are there and that just makes it really hard,negative
your collection has been growing so much year after year it’s amazing,positive

im suddenly questioning myself how we can solve it in one five patterns,neutral
nice loop ,positive
i love ur editing and also wow when you just look at a cube you don’t think that there’s 43 quintillion combinations cool,positive
yea but cant the centers also be oriented in different ways like with picture cubes its possible to have the whole cube solve except one center piece thats rotated,neutral

congratulations man this was really an insane effort you goal was almost impossible and you did it i really cant imagine solving big cubes for 5h omg,positive
i really congratulate you my hand hurt even just watching it i dont know how you endure this pain but i can say that you are a really patient and determined person although i love this video you shouldnt push yourself so hard to show us these you can produce simpler content anyway i wish you continued success,positive
i’m curious if solving them biggest to smallest would change it at all by the time your eyes are tired the hardest of them would be done might be worth a comparison some time,neutral

amazing work ryden you’ll be under a minute in no time how good are rubik’s cubes right ,positive
go ryden great work we love this thanks for sharing,positive
wowgood job,positive
it makes me feel so proud because i was about his age when i learned how to solve my first rubiks cube,positive
im a speed cuber myself the mindset to improve at speedcubing is the same one skateboarders have you gotta keep pushing your limits i bet you that in two months hell be doing less than 25 seconds consistently get him the speed stacking timer and also some kind of mat to protect whatever hes gonna drop his cube at,neutral
hey ryder as a cuber with a sub 30 average just i recommend smooth and consistent movements to speed up however you’re doing amazing you will get 1 minute in no minute and you are so fast for not much practice keep working buddy,positive
i am beyond proud of ryden i’m a speedcuber this is so amazing to see,positive

you cant use the timer on a black surface as black doesnt reflect infrared light try using it on a white table,negative
the 251m is a great cube the newer versions which are one of the air leap or pro and the air has not as many features as the pro and leap and the leap just has bigger core magnets than the pro which can sometimes be a disadvantage i main the 251m pro with the default ges and set it up with 23 drops of dnm which stops most of the catches and lockups,positive
something you could use the gan 356is for is switch the cores and pieces around with different cubes like the wrm or the x,neutral
awesome unboxingas always of the cubes that i can’t buy lol,positive

i cant be the only one who always preffered stickers until i actually tried stickerless lmao,neutral
i personally love the look of stickerless they just look so much cleaner imo,positive
i really appreciate you covering the colorblind aspect i have to have grey instead of green and black instead of orange on my cubes because of my color deficiency and it means significantly less choice in cubes its very frustraiting,negative
it would actually be nice to have stickerless cubes reproducing the scheme of stickered cubes with black lines around the pieces this is the reason why i prefer stickered cubes the alternance between colors and black kind of like shadows make each piece stand out more and you get this really cool 3d aspect like you can really tell each piece is a small cube in itself which with a stickerless cube is just not possible it just seems like one big cube do you know what i mean edit i guess what i wanted to say in a few words is that stickerless cubes visually have a lack of depth which i don’t really like,positive
what i find good about stickerless is that you can be almost 100 sure that if youre buying a stickerless cube it will turn at least halfdecent while on stickered you may run into unfilleted cubes that require wrist rotations like the original rubiks series of course you always look closely at what youre buying but it just seems like an interesting little detail to think about,positive
thats the first time i see someone talking about colorblind speedcubers as a colorblind guy i always had a stickered cube thank you for talking about this a little bit love your vids,positive
i competed back when stickerless was illegal so i was thrilled when it was legalized just to find i enjoy stickered more i like when the stickers get worn it shows mileage on a cube which i think is cool,positive
for me whether or not the cube is stickered actually matters a lot i have always used a stickerless cube and when i got a stickered cube i noticed that i was a lot worse at look ahead i made more mistakes in f2l and took longer to look,negative
i have always used stickerless cubes from when i learned all through now one day a friend and i swapped cubes to see how our times got affected by using each other cubes i like my cubes fast he likes them slower his main was a stickered cube not only was i turning bad because the cube was slower then i was use to but the stickers felt so weird i just cant use stickered cubes because of the edge on the sticker,negative
i prefer stickered on 3x3 because i love the look any bigger cubes the amount of stickers just makes it not worth it to me to many that can get damaged and replacing stickers gets exponentially more annoying i would probably feel differently if the stickers from speedcubeshop werent as good as they are so i would still take a stickered 3x3 over a stickerless given the option,negative
you can get the cube here ,positive

i’ve had the rainbow ball for about 9 years now it’s very easy and basically pointless but it’s good for young children and collectors,positive
thankyou guys,positive
congratulaions you just solved an already solved cube,positive
basic cubing rule doing any set of moves will eventually put the cube to the solved state like if you do a set of moves like r u r u on a scrambled cube it will still be unsolved,neutral
doing that algorithm on an unsolved cube 6 times will just put it in the same unsolved state,neutral
if you keep repeating the exact same steps on an unsolved cube it will come back to what it was before but since you used an already solved cube it came back to itself because you repeated the steps until it went again but if you do it on an unsolved cube itll just go back to how unsolved it was at the start,neutral
i forget the trick and now i am solving for 1000000 years,neutral
this is exactly what i was searching for thanks dude ,positive
you have teached me to solve the rubix cube thanks,positive

i’ve tried so many tutorials and this video was the only one that was able to teach me how to solve it you explain everything so thoroughly and in a way that’s easy to understand… you should make a tutorial for the 4x4,positive
this tutorial is amazing i was a bit confused at the end when finishing off but i eventually solved it hours later i cant believe it only took 2 days for me to solve thats really amazing for a beginner i really expected it to take weeks but it was only 2 days,positive
thank you so much for this video all of the other tutorials were a bit harder to follow but your video was followable and all of the steps were easy and organised once again thank you so much,positive
you are a fabulous teacher no ego showing off or any of the things that discourage new cubers so clear and user friendly i am an older person who has cubed for 15 years i solve many cubes cuboids odd shaped magic cubes and supercubes and these often require the basic moves you teach here so while this is very beginner it is also very useful for advanced complex cubes that cant be solved with advanced algs a pleasure i will show this video to a young neighbor whom i just gave a 3x3 and she is very excited about it i feel shed do well with your great teaching style,positive
i have been trying to solve a rubik’s cube for a year and your video has made me very confident around rubik’s cubes thank you for making this video,positive

fantastic tutorial much better than the others i watched its not lengthy and simply explained time frames are much appreciated the only thing i did not enjoy in the tutorial is the last layer part bc the algorithm was not taught in the intro and i messed it up due to the lack of practice on a side note i liked when you voiced the algorithm sequence not just showed,positive

the fact that it’s already solved,neutral
its either up or downhahaha btw nice video,positive
it wouldn’t be that difficult to fix the rubik’s brand smaller core smoother edges and the corners in the pieces could be rounded for more corner cutting,neutral
j perm once brought up that rubiks brand doesnt really corner twist or pop for nonspeedcubers who wouldnt know how to fix those issues in a way that keeps the cube solvable its more important cube design makes these things impossible than it is important for cubes to be fast,neutral
i recently got myself the impossible cube that you showed at the end there regular rubiks brand and it both popped and had stickers fall off right out of the box i believe they either dont give a shit because theyre still the largest or theyre incompetent,negative
i think its also built the way it is to prevent the cube from popping and corner twists you have to keep in mind its the og cube meant for people that dont understand the puzzle and if anything like that were to happen then the puzzle is therefore broken to them,neutral
i have a rubiks cube thats almost 20 years old i got into cubing recently and bought a meilong as soon as i got some disposable pennies i always assumed that it turns this horrible at least in part because of its age but seeing how your brand new cube turns exactly like mine now i wish i could get my hands on a new one just to see if there is any difference,negative
my friends are going to a speed cubing comp next week so they wanted to get me into it too currently have a broken thumb and a rubiks brand cube my best time is 34556 i learned how to solve it 3 days ago and i’m currently dreaming of how fast i can get my time up to if i had a working cube and thumb,positive
i have only had a rubiks cube for the entirety of my speed cubing journey im finally going to get a good speed cube but my best time on a regular cube is 40 seconds it can be improved im sure,positive
the og rubiks cube was set up to be basically temperamental child proof like you demonstrated you can throw it at a wall and the wall will lose that battle but its also super unlikely to pop or cornertwist during normal use noncubers often consider a cube broken if its popped or cornertwisted i remember having to rescue an expensive speedcube from the trash can because my cousin cornertwisted it that comes at the expense of having almost no cornercutting ability and having a lot of friction making it hard to turn but then again its not meant to be their speedcube the rubiks brand speedcube is still kinda terrible though but for different reasons,negative
i have had a rubixs cube for about 6 years now and in all that time it has never popped i am not much of a speedcuber but i average at around 40 seconds on that cube and i know about 10 algorithms it has got a couple of scratches but it still works like a charm now i am going more into speedcubing and i am considering buying a magnetic speedcube,positive
love how you make videos for noncubers too i hope it will make more people into speedcubing3,positive

my mother used to use plastic ice cubes back in the 90s i impressed all my friends they were colorful and cool i also was the first vegan on my block my friends would beg for our vegan food which was really just regular food with no cheese or meat haha yeah i miss those days haven’t tried the metal ones nice,positive
keep in mind that real ice cubes can absorb 45 times more heat than steel ones so it isn’t consuming as much heat and might burn you if your drink was above 60 celsius about i didn’t do the math water can absorb 9 times what steel can even,neutral
just a tiny minus you cant chew on the ice,negative
the one fear i have with these things is accidentally swallowing them its easy to forget theyre not really ice cubes id use a straw with these 100 of the time,negative
i remember going to a friends house and seeing these but the plastic version and i thought they were real so i was there trying to bite through their plastic ice cubes while my friend just stared in shock,negative
i used to freeze a metal spoon and use it to stir my hot drinks when i was a kid i totally recommend it if you just want to chill it and be done,positive
how to solve the rubiks cube faster ► please read this before commenting i try to reply often but i dont get step x or it doesnt work is too unspecific and i cant help unless i know exactly what problem you have make sure you know the 4 moves 152 has the 4 moves and you have to be able to do this to understand what 4 moves means when i use it again later on common first layer problems step 1 2 if the side colors of the cross or first layer dont line up the way i showed it in the video then you need to redo it pay attention to all of the colors on one piece and dont just pick white pieces randomly i talk about this in the video how im trying to match the other colors of the white piece like whiteorange etc taking pieces out of the second layer step 3 at 533 i say you should already know how to do this i admit this is unclear you should insert a random yellow edge into the second layer using the same algorithm you use for solving the second layer if this does not make sense watch the example solve video linked at the bottom of this comment common top layer problems step 4 if you can only get 1 or 3 edge pieces of the top cross you need to reassemble the cube as solved step 5 there should be no problems here step 6 if you ever get only 2 corners in the correct location you need to reassemble the cube as solved step 7 finish the 4 moves dont stop at 3 every time turn the bottom dont rotate the whole cube to get the next piece if it still does not work you need to reassemble the cube as solved why do i need to reassemble the cube randomly assembling the cube only has a 112 chance of being solvable if youve ever taken the cube apart or twisted corner pieces then that can be the problem if stickers have been switched you will have to switch them back full example solve,negative
“learn the rubix cube in 10 min” 3 hours of going back 10 seconds later edit i’d just like to announce that i have done the “impossible” and solved the cube if someone such as myself can then i’m more than hopeful whoever reads this is capable of doing the same,positive
this actually worked really well for me the first time i tried it it took me awhile but i got to the last step then messed it up but i realized it was still partially solved somehow except the yellow was the one that was solved and the white was broken up i just redid the last few steps with the cube upsidedown yellow on the bottom and white on the top and it worked thanks for this wonderful tutorial this was my first time solving a rubiks cube,positive
this is clearly an old video but lemme say ive been watching this video everyday for the last week or two and i can finally solve the cube without watching its been a long waiting bucket list thing to solve this without help and i got it thanks j perm loved the video and your content,positive
i love this tutorial its pretty easy to follow thank you,positive
thanks man even tho i never would have got this on my own it was still super satisfying to solve one for the first time ,positive
nothing hurts more than being on the last step and then messing up the algorithm,negative
took me couple hours but i did it thanks to this guide appreciate it ,positive
thanks you so much for this video solved my first cube today with your help ,positive
thank you i am now part of the small percentage of people to completely solve a rubiks cube couldnt have done it without this video,positive
this song hit different when you actually having a good day,positive

this guy deserved the finals at the least man his acts increased in complexity in each stage his presentation was nice he was polite as well indulged the judges in all the acts they were all genuinely suprised i dont know why he didnt get the chance thou,positive

first the rubiks brand then magnetic then maglev and now smart cubes the evolution of rubiks cubes are taking a change for the better and its because of people like u spreading the message far and widelets show some love for the cubing youtube community,positive

i personally love watching stockfish magnus leela and any other chess engines at your channel,positive
1722 stockfish 15 awarding stockfish 15 a brilliant move be like yes incredible i definitely would not have seen it,positive
levy on tcec top chess engine championship there were some engine games with stockfish leela komodo etc where they played double fischer random chess dfrc essentially the pieces are randomized for both sides the games were extremely fascinating and often mind boggling you should check them out they are in the archive for s22 on dfrc i think,positive
please keep these engine games coming levy like more from tcec engine games are always so fascinating because of how high level they are,positive
i like this this should be a new series computer chess war or something,positive
you should do stockfish 15 vs 8 again but have them swap sides after 20 or 30 moves see if the engine is strong enough to come from behind something like that be interesting to see how the strong engine plays from behind instead of ahead the whole way,neutral
three queens engines are just so sick great content with some teaching points for us carbon based units taking space and patience are key lessons thanks,positive
i would like to see this game but giving time odds or processor odds to stockfish 8 until it wins just to compare,neutral
magnus playing in titled tuesday and speed chess championship letss goooooooo,positive
the first thing i thought when this video began was that magnus would probably be playing in the scc again damn i’m excited,positive
this is exciting apart from tt and scc theres a new global world championship too bad the rcc just finished imagine seeing magnus play every weekend against other strong players,positive
yooooooo what always felt such a hole in the chess world with magnus not participating much in the big chesscom events just because of his other tie ups this is amazing,positive
so we will see magnus in scc and some title tuesdays now thats a great news looking forward to see more magnus vs hikaru,positive
imagine magnus commentating world championship alongside with caruanahikaru,neutral
itll be cool to see the magnus bots alongside the other top player bots on the site or even in a special areaapp,positive
magnus is a pure business man ,positive
hikaru im very excited to abandon internet chess and go for classical tournaments again,positive
its never about who bring magnus or hikaru at least for me its about free analysis and quicker and lighter website so i will always go with lichess,positive
huge fan of hikaru giving us insight like this into the mindset of the super gm world fide reminds me of the intractability of major league baseball and their outdated traditions,neutral
anyone else want a magnus hikaru podcast where they both dunk on fide or is it just me,neutral
hikaru himself is proof of why online chess is so important to grow the game lol kinda explains itself,positive
hikarus video speaks for itself,neutral
i think they are upset from magnus because he is not defending his world championship title because of which they will suffer revenue losses less people will see ding vs nepo compared to magnus vs nepo less ads less sponsorship less online viewership etc,negative
hikaru continually having magnus back and showing him great respect is why despite his flaws i am still a hikaru fan,positive
i prefer esports chess it looks cooler more comfortable for the players and they can move faster,positive
i also take playing random moves less slowly than my opponent extremely seriously,neutral
emils perspective is a classic example of the fallacy of zero sum thinking where shallow thinkers believe that when one side wins the other necessarily losses of course when it comes to things like chess this kind of thinking is completely erroneous and on the contrary when one side wins both sides win what is good for one aspect of chess is broadly speaking good for chess as a whole we should be doing everything possible to broaden chesss appeal garner additional exposure and grow its global popularity and online chess obviously plays an enormous role in that process what is good for online chess is also good for otb chess fide and other large bureaucratic institutions will hopefully eventually recognize and embrace this too,neutral
fair criticisms on both sides however “online” chess played while 6ft away from your opponent is just ridiculous,negative
the monsterous power of the bishop pair demonstrated with elegant moves and amazing game ,positive
amazing attacking game i thought once grieve lost the exchange it would be a slow conversion for white but that bishop pair was really sick i love it whenever i get a bishop fortified by a pawn behind it so deep into the position its like a thorn in the opponents play easily worth an exchange,positive
hopefully they dont ruin chessable is the only good product that playmagnus has,positive
this reminds me of nezhmetdinovs bishop pair against chernikov,neutral
it would be interesting to see how stockfish would win the game as white especially white was up material but finding moves was the hard part,neutral
danny rensch taking over play magnus is chesss version of elon musk buying twitter,neutral
chesscom has become the chess equivalent of disney,neutral
magnus owns 85 of play magnus the bid is nok 800m so he gets nok 68m equivalant to approx usd 7 million not bad ,positive
suggestion ivan sokolov vs tiger hillarp persson 1997 koge open denmark a wild and beautiful tactical game involving queen sacrifice and an awesome mating net definitely deserves a video do check it out,positive
that really is an amazing game white material advantage blacks ruined structure but the bishop pair and a long king walk to finish a great game with promotions on both sides and a queen sac,positive
the goal should be to get better not look for simple openings good luck getting to 2000 just playing the englund traxler ponziani staffford and danish gambit maybe this advice holds true for those who have a 5060 game accuracy or 100 centipawn loss in their 10 min games but not for more advanced players,neutral
objectively the bongcloud opening must be the most horrendous of options however at the same time it is hikarus trademark bongcloud is beyond good and evil,negative
bong cloud has one variation super easy to learn and surprises the opponent has to be the top 3 openings,positive
i think the point gotham is making especially with the ruy lopez sicilian is that openings of that caliber require such precision and accurate play that unless youre willing to really spend a lot of time with minute details and study youre going to play them wrong even if you win games with them itll be in spite of your opening not because of it generally speaking hes clearly talking about beginner intermediate caliber players chess purists can relax,neutral
just wanna point out something interesting 1228 the alapin variation of the sicilian defence with c3 and d4 is the exact reverse of the main line variation of the english opening with c6d5 both of them are bad for the one playing against them please listen to this man and take some of his advice to heart,negative
you should make a series of this for different rating tiers,neutral
my man levy just had mvl on his podcast then takes a massive dump on all of mvls openings for black,negative
accepting the queens gambit still remains to be my most traumatic experience in chess i remember innocently grabbing that pawn and immediately regretting playing chess,negative

i have been playing the grünfeld for sometime now and honestly against 1300 lower its not that bad if you do a little study won very good games with c5,positive
what a sunday champion vs challenger magnus vs pragnnandha its going to be a cracker ,positive
im pretty sure this wasnt actually the case but it almost looked like magnus made a bet maybe with himself that he could make x number of moves with his queen and y number of moves with his king and still win or maybe just still reach move 30 that would explain both his laughter and generally humorous demeanor and amateurlike play this might be considered some innocent type of trolling or even an inside joke but i suspect that if something akin or analogous to this had occurred in the nba or nfl or mlb some persons would be calling for an investigation just looking for a hypothesis that would account for what occurred in game one of the carlsen firouzja match note how strangely carlsen played in game four was it of his match with pragg i dont know how much las vegas type betting goes on with respect to the world of chess but a game like this could make someone who put money on the game very unhappy in some ways it was embarrassing to watch i dont believe that type of behavior advanced the cause of pro chess,neutral
everyone was so worried about him magnus not taking it seriously when he showed clearly it didnt matter how you look during a match the board speaks for itself to my fellow chess playersplay the board not the person also if they didnt want anyone expressing theyre facial expressions and such they would have made the tournament traditional and face to face this chess society has so much to improve on when it comes to just playing the board the point of this game is whose mind is stronger who ever has the advantage in the meta wins always wake up chess world,neutral
i wonder who simon is supporting it is hard to tell i wish all players the best of luck in the next round,positive

chess pieces pawn the very first line of attack can move 2 spaces forward only on the first move while only moving 1 spaces forward the next move takes enemys pieces if the pieces is in leftright side in front can be promoted into any pieces except king if a pawn got into the last tile of the enemys side knight moves in an l shape can jump over pieces bishop can move in an x shape can go for how long you want it to be cant jump over pieces rook can go in a shape can go for how long you want it to be cant jump over pieces you can do a move called castle if your rook can reach the king and both pieces havent move dont know if that last part is right queen can go in a and x shape cant jump over pieces king can move 1 spaces around it like a 3×3 square protect this piece as best as you can a checkmate will be an immediate lose cant jump over pieces,neutral

rooks can move in straight lines left and right or up and down but cant jump over other pieces bishops can move diagonally as far as it wants as long as there is no pieces in the way of it knights the only piece that can jump other pieces and can move in the shape of an l king can only move 1 time in any direction is known as the most important piece but also the most useless queen can move as far as she wants in any direction as long as theres not a piece blocking her small edit she is also known as the strongest piece on the board pawns pawns can move forwards 2 times on the first turn but only once after that on following turns and can only kill moving diagonally forward if the pawn reaches the opponents side of the board you can substitute it for any of your former pieces lost ie if you lost the queen you could bring the queen back by getting a pawn to the opponents side i hope i didnt miss anything also i hope this helps oh and a side note white always goes first,neutral

someone is inevitably going to make a playable online chess 2 and i cannot wait,positive
i feel like this would legitimately be a fun variation on chess,positive
i love this new update it implements a rework for basically every card and a new middle piece a jail system which is very cool and adds incetives to protect and keep alive the monkey since he can save the king giving him a great passive buff also the fish queens that even now are fake is still a great advantage to have and i personally like more that way and the new rook with his flying abilities making a great way to protect other pieces and more gameplay variety and finally a little edit to the color of the chess board who i agree the reasoning for tho is probably harder to get a blueish board than a black and white one but is not a big issue and after mentioning all of that i will give to this update a 1410 amazing work,positive

honestly i appreciate you and your content technical analysis is good but i find it truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure ta and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why btc is pumpspumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems its kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each etf launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of btc we were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumpsnarrowly avoiding a longterm bear market more emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market i have made over 12 btc from day tradng with wtrade inspects insights and charts they been one step ahead of other analysis,negative
ccrypto is off helping to regulate rather than pretend it wont ever happen the big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into the stratosphere most people dont like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize and benefits they were unaware with before turn out to be far more beneficial few if any rug pulls the projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space i’d get involved more knowing that i have made over 16 btc from daytrade with wtrade inspects in few weeks,neutral

so happy for pragg  i was thinking push your pawns pragg at the end game please push your pawns and when he finally started doing that he had much better winning chances well done,positive
pragg continuing to be the comeback king amazing play he made this tournament extremely exciting was just glued to all his games and magnus also played really well at the start but i lost respect for him towards the end when in the interviews he just kept making excuses for his defeats and tried to discredit pragg completely he couldnt even look at pragg for even a second as he was speaking and looked so disinterested the least you could do even if u dont congratulate him or admit he played well is acknowledge him and he couldnt even do that which is a shame because magnus has carried himself so well in the past and praised pragg before so its not that he cant but simply he couldnt accept the defeats today which is so disappointing from a professional player like him rlly left a bitter taste but im soo happy for pragg that even if he didnt win the tournament he certainly showed hes a force to be reckoned with and won our hearts with his persistence which was just so inspiring,positive

i really liked the way the game was described each move was analyzed with possible options giving the viewer opportunity to see how fischer developed his strategy some commentators are too fast too slick this was much better,positive
jerry your videos are some of the most instructive on the internet my top 3 favorite youtubers are you gotham and daniel naroditsky gotham teaches you how to understand broad overarching concepts like a master daniel teaches you how to understand the fine details like a master and you teach us how to realize what masterlevel thinking even looks like seriously i studied tactics and positional chess for years and couldnt advance past 1200 but your beginner to gm series totally revolutionized the way i looked at the board i gained more in the 2 years since i watched those videos than i did in my previous 5 years of serious chess study,positive

thats my cousin always had a kind heart and always loved chess while we were goofing around as kids i would watch that boy read chess books and wash grown men im so proud of you man,positive
she said danny plays an aggressive style but actually if you look he is quite positional loves the two bishops and throws in an h4 to throw off his opponent he tries to make make very tiny advantages that eventually point at your king i simply love his playing style,positive
im so impressed by danny’s ability to delay castles in both games he seems very aware of the positional advantages that he can take by delaying,positive
anna love the videos 2 suggestions 1 itd be awesome if you could show the clock somehow maybe a digital clock that can be synchronized to the video 2 if you or opponent resign a 30 second explanation of why it was resigns at the end would be awesome in this case i saw your b on a5 was hanging and whites rook defending their e2 bishop but its not always super easy for us to figure out,positive
anna took two losses in a row and was laughing and having fun with a strong player its amazing to watch two pros go neck and neck at each other like this thank you so much,positive
other than an amazing player danny seems really modest and kind i wish i was living anywhere near these kinds of parks i love how its nice weather people casually walking by and stop to spectate the game it kind of restores my faith in this world,positive

at this point hans niemanns chess has stopped speaking now its screaming in pain,negative
we keep saying its the magnus effect not talking about basketballs and dams here but would be interesting to test this in an esport i follow age of empires 2 one player theviper was so dominant for so long that a streamer t90official came up with the idea of an event he called hidden cup where everyones identities were hidden and only revealed at the end each player was given a name to play under so nobody knew who was who was a really interesting concept as there were awesome games and so much speculation over who was who theyve repeated the format 4 times now which says something about how loved it is but with chess being an online thing now this kind of event is very possible and i think would be fascinating would magnus still win theviper did so proved that theory wrong at least for him,positive
if he was winning nobody would be talking very true wordshopefully hans will comeback,positive

spasky was arguably even more impressive by being a grandmaster of kindness,positive
i remember watching an interview with fischer and he mentioned how during matches even the wrong lighting would throw him off definitely seems like he might have had sensory issues that weren’t well understood at the time,negative
spasky was honestly the mvp of the story with giving into fischers demands to ensure he got a fair shot to prove his title even though he was being pressured to win at all costs by the soviet union just because he respected him plus even though fischer went off grid for like twenty years spasky was willing to go out of his way to play with him again then to try and personally protest for his release from prison and even ask to stay in his cell to play chess with him just because he respected his skill so much,neutral
my grandfather actually played with bobby regularly in 1956 at the west orange chess club in new jersey they played on the same team in interstate tournaments i found some of my grandpa’s old letters and it’s pretty cool he won multiple chess championships some amateur and some professional in the late 40s and early 50s he also was involved in a few professional chess clubs and magazines he was born in 1909 and while i like to think he taught bobby a thing or two to help him gain his immense success that year it’s likely the 13 year old schooled my grandpa my grandpa quit chess in 1957 to turn professional in bridge because it was better financially chess tournaments didn’t pay well back then though he probably played teenage bobby enough to know he stood no chance in the future if a 13 year old made a multitime champion quit the game entirely he must have been truly special my grandpa could card count so i don’t think he had a problem switching to bridge and became a national life master in bridge and had a successful career i never got to meet him because he died before i was born i’m only 23 i would’ve loved to ask him about bobby maybe my mom knows a bit more all i have are letters and a few chess trophies it’s very hard to collect information from the early 50s,positive
he thought the us government was out to get him to be fair they did have a warrant out for his arrest i mean on that front he wasnt wrong,neutral
the light sensitivity and erratic behavior are symptoms of a person on the spectrum it is not uncommon for people like this to prefer lamps to ceiling lights as the glare is annoying to them lashing out comes from difficulty communicating feeling different and knowing you are different it is easy to believe that you are being mocked and lacking the skills to compete it is easier to flee than fight fishers mental health was probably not caused by chess but the pressure that came to surround him due to his success at chess while playing he probably felt safe knowing the rules knowing everyone had to obey them and that he would not be mocked for some social faux pas he didnt understand or care about,negative
this story should also be a story of boris spassky if the information is correct the guy is a really decent person spassky could repeat could be a world champ without competing but no when fischer had his ticks spassky said just give in and lets play many years later spassky told then uspresident bush to free spassky and even met fischer in prison to play chess boris spassky was obvisously one of a kind a human face of communism,neutral
my dad tried to teach me chess i was only 10 he was 52 i picked up the moves of the pieces easily halfway through our first game he said “do you have a strategy or are you just making moves at random” i said “making moves at random” he boxed up the pieces and that was that i later turned out to be a terrific poker player ,positive

first of all as someone that has played chess for close to 20 years on and off i am impressed with the results that michelle made in a short time chess is a game that you have to play for months at the very least to become good at it takes time to recognize patterns and then feel comfortable enough playing against someone else that has also been playing for a while you did great michelle,positive

im officially addicted to rewatching this shit over and over i think michelle really put her finger on the main problem with chess because its so much tied to our perception of intelligence not being good enough makes you feel dumb and embarrassed rather than just treating it as another skill to learn once you get over this barrier in your head it becomes fun,negative

moving over to ios from android in september looking at picking up the iphone 14 pro max if i can get a great deal at a later date im looking at adding airpods pro 1 or 2 was going to stick with android but due to the samsung s22 ultra being shipped with the exynos chip and throttling back performance in the uk its led me to switching to an iphone,positive

i used to own a time machine well actually a time capsule but the drive in it failed i would love to see apple bring back a modern version of that device the pro watch is attractive i’m still rocking a 6 and forget about any new iphone until they have usbcthunderbolt 4,positive
will wait one more year for the universal connectivity of usbc and the better battery life and speed of the 3nm processor,positive

lets go its satellite time baby ,positive
my day instantly gets better whenever sam uploads i cant wsit for this event i hope we get the satellite connectivity feature the new prices are terrifying ,positive
it seems way more likely to me that the invite is actually referring to astrophotography the iphone has improved a lot in the last few years at lowlight photography especially if youre using a tripod plus if theres going to be a 48mp camera sensor thatll be amazingly helpful for nighttime shots im about as confident about that as sam is about it being satellite connectivity ,positive
ill be upgrading to the iphone 14 pro max after using an 8 plus for five years so i imagine ill really feel that upgrade stoked,positive
i seriously hope ian and luke is on the genius bar podcast this week,positive

order of event prediction 1 intro what apple has achieved so far this year eco stuff privacy etc 2 apple tv showsmovies and more apple music songs announcement 3 iphone 14s 4 iphone 14 pros 5 ipad 10th gen 6 apple watch series 8 7 apple watch pro 8 software release with exact date for ios and a rough date for ipados and macos,positive
my guess for the order of the event 1 new tv shows 2 update to the budget ipad 3 apple watch s8 4 iphone 14 regular 5 iphone 14 pro,neutral
heres my prediction for the products being launched 0 some new subscription service probably related to apple tv 1 airpods pro 2 2 apple watch regular se then pro probably with some new fitness related service as well 3 iphone 14 series regular then pros,positive
i missed fpt welcome back jon ,positive
heres my current prediction for this event intro what apple had achieved this year compared to other years new apple tv plus subscription service updated ipad airpod pros 2 apple watch regular se then pro probably with a new fitness service iphone 14 series regular then pros,positive
here are my predictions 1 something small related to their services probably something related to apple tv 2 watches sethen regular after that pro 3 iphones regulars then pros,neutral
my prediction for that event will be they will start off with the the new software and the new chip then move on to the apple watches and after they last thing will be all about the iphone and of course the iphone 14 pro and pro max with all the new functions well that’s my predictions hope to with that iphone but still best of luck to every one ,positive
good to see you back john my prediction 1 new subscription service 2 new software update ios then ipados 3 airpods pros 2 4 apple watch 8 then ruggedpro edition 5 iphone 14 regular then pros,positive
whos excited for september 7th,positive
when it comes to apple the key to the hints they give is not to overthink it and i’m pretty sure this is related to the newer bigger camera that’s gonna be on the phones that will take beautiful pictures of the night sky if there’s one thing i’ve learned about apple in the past 10 years is that they aren’t that deep,positive
it’s going to be sooo awesome this year and i can’t wait for all the fun we’re gonna have in the livestream  i really hope the iphone 14 pro’s coming purple it’s my first time not wanting to buy the space gray ,positive
it’s be great if they gave us the feature to watch a video in one screen while watching on a live show to start in another screen top and bottom also the ability to add covers to the multi app clusters to make the screen look cleaner the ability to to swipe conversations to the side like picture in picture while doin other things instead of having to go back and forth between apps,positive
im excited to see what apple announces at the event im really hoping for a camera with more than 12 megapixels i think it would be a game changer for sure especially for photographers like me all in all im excited for the event,positive
i am very excited i do believe it is focused on iphone and apple watch along with maybe some new airpod pro models the ipad release along with a new mac pro computer will come in october it will be strange getting ios watchos and tvos updates but no ipad out west on the same day it is called confusion apple needs to work on consistency and not just jumping around like they decided to do if that is what will happen i’d like apple because of their consistency and being able to keep things in the same time frame hopefully i was 16 and watchos along with tvos will be released on monday september 12 which is a scheduled day off for me from work i do not like getting updates while i am at work because it will take time to install them i did watch youtube video from a different channel and i replied to the comments about compatibility for next year and he thought that iphone 8 would not be compatible with ios 17 in 2023 do you think this is true if so should my parents who have iphone 8 models should upgrade this year or wait until before i was 17 comes out out i did tell them about the iphone se thirdgeneration because neither one seems interested in upgrading to my iphone 12 or getting one with face id themselves,positive
seems odd to create ar creative around satellite tech since it’s just for emergencies but also agree doesn’t seem like cameras will get tech for astro photography as you’d think other issues with phone photography need to be addressed before trying to shoot stars in any case glad they put out the invites a week earlier than usual — i’ll be able to plan for get readypreorderapu if all models are ontime,neutral
i usually switch back and forth yearly between apple and android as i like both fanboy of neither but apple is hitting a peak and really not innovating much anymore i’m just going to switch from the 13 pro max to the s22 ultra as i said i love both but i’m not seeing any reasons to upgrade with apple this year if the 15 is a game changer it will be right up my yearly cycle routine switch between both ,positive
thank you so much brandoni love your entertaining and informative videosi really appreciate your efforts and dedicationyou are so awesome and amazingi can’t wait for the iphone 14s and ios 16keep up your great efforts brandon,positive
here’s an  what if apple made an iphone mini 2 starting around 1099with three cameras no notch but have it the size of the current 13 mini small but super powerful and i know a bunch of people would buy it cmon mini gang where yall at,positive

the thing i am most interested in is seeing how apple will sell the 14 with a straight face,positive
airpods without stems would loose their character,negative
1 thing to expect apple will punk the leakers for the third event in a row,neutral
i truly appreciate your videos because of you i’ve kept my xsmax and my apple watch 5 i don’t see the need to upgrade until next year if apple go to the usbc,positive
good news with keeping the stem i always wondered how they could pull a stem removal off without killing usability i mean how the hell should you press a button when this thing is turning 180° and then buttons are on the inside,negative
iphone 14 will be the most amazing incredible outrageous thing anyone has seen anywhere in all of time and even beyond time it will run ios 15 come in many colors take great photos and videos will be able to charge on a little black plate on a table extreme perfect infinite edit whenever and always multitask exquisitely play very special music and movies and like the last 3 generations will be enable you to multi task at lightning speed but perhaps a little faster but you will not be able to notice since the last one was so fast it will be pure magic ,positive
i am ready for september 7 hopefully ios 16 and watchos now will come out on monday the 12th that would be a good release date i find it funny that ipados will be delayed a month that is very strange it seems like apple would just wait until stage manager got fixed and release it with a subsequent update like ipados 161 or 1601,positive
was really hoping the airpods would have some sort of hearing losshearing aid abilities there is a stigma and pricing on real hearing aids whereas most headphones phone combos have far more processing and programming abilities to the nerfed offerings from hearing aid manufacturers it would be a massive market to tap into and takeover for whichever phone maker does it first,neutral
on the beta ios 16 there is a battery indicator feature in battery settings it is automatically set so default to only show in low power mode instead of the bar decreasing it will always show you your battery ,positive
tolles video  schade das sie die notch nicht lassen bis sie komplett unter dem display verschwindet ist doch eigentlich das erkennungszeichen vom iphone ich glaube das sie das iphone mini alle paar jahre wieder aktualisiert bringen werden da ich erst letztes jahr beim 13pro max zugeschlagen habe wird es dieses jahr wohl ein update von meinem 2017er ipad pro 105 werden mal schauen was im oktober kommt gruß an alle ,neutral
mein standpunkt jedes produkt ohne usbc wird nicht gekauft beispielsweise hätte ich gerne kopfhörer die airpods pro sollen es werden das geld liegt bereit durch den lightninganschluss wären sie schon vor dem kauf veraltet und ein fehlkauf das gleiche gilt auch für die iphones das ende anderer anschlüsse ist durch die eu eingeleitet und steht fest,neutral
das highlight wenn es denn überhaupt kommt dürfte die apple watch pro werden vor allem beim preis  oder die normale apple watch im kantigen design das neue iphone ob nun groß oder klein wirkt für mich persönlich recht unspektakulär recycling iphone pro aus dem vorjahr gleiches gilt für die iphone promodelle ob nun pille oder notch selbst wenn die kamera jetzt noch „unbelievable“ wäre würde mir das keine 1200 euro aus der geldbörse locken ich denke es wird auch das letzte iphone mit einem achip überhaupt sein nächstes jahr wird auch das iphone auf den mchip umgestellt meiner meinung nach längst überfällig ich rechne noch fest mit neuen airpods oder airpods pro interessant dürfte sein was mit dem apple tv passiert auch mit der überarbeitung des homepod mini rechne ich fest von einem neuen alten „homepod“ gehe ich derzeit nicht aus mich persönlich interessiert nur die neue watch da bei meine 4er langsam der akku schlapp macht und apple nächstes jahr bei dem 4er modell den softwarehahn endgültig zudrehen wird das wird vielen so gehen da viele noch das 4er modell haben und schon seit einem jahr auf das kantige design warten aber eins steht für mich auch ganz klar fest kein kantiges design keine neue apple watch dann muss die 4er bei mir noch ein jahr irgendwie weiter überleben ,neutral
vielleicht bekommt ja der lightning anschluss der iphones ein speed update auf usb 3x das hatten sie auch im letzten ipad pro verbaut allerdings damals ein langsamer usb 3 chip der nur rund die doppelte usb 2 geschwindigkeit konnte also technisch wäre es ja machbar wenn sie wollten dann wären auch die großen videos schneller am pcmac,neutral
die apple watch 8 wird vermutlich meine erste apple watch werden bin mal gespannt,neutral
ich freue mich natürlich auf den event und bin wie immer gespannt was ich aber mit meinem iphone mache weiß ich noch nicht ich bin mit dem 12er noch immer vollkommen zufrieden und habe über die vielen vorangegangenen versionen und käufe gelernt dass ich eigentlich mit dem neuen iphone meist genau dasselbe mache wie mit dem vorherigen eigentlich sollte ich das 12pro erst ersetzen wenn es entweder kaputt geht oder der akku am ende seines lebens ist beides trifft nicht zu vermutlich staune ich über das neue iphone und vielleicht bin ich neidisch auf schöne neue farben aber dann nehme ich meins aus der hülle und stelle fest dass mein oceam blue auch nicht so übel ist  zusammengefasst verspüre ich keinen wunsch oder gar drang ein neues iphone anzuschaffen und bin mit meinem happy vermutlich überspringe ich das 14er auch noch um dann beim 15er zuzuschlagen,neutral
ich werde bestimmt nicht dabei sein – und ich hätte auch überhaupt nichts dagegen wenn apple nur alle 3 jahre oder so mal ein neues modell herausbringt wer braucht alle diese marginalen verbesserungen mein altes se ist immer noch ein sehr gutes telefon verwaltet termine und nachrichten prima und unterstützt die organisation meines business ganz hervorragend,neutral
ich bin noch unentschlossen entweder das iphone 14 max oder das pro max werde die keynote abwarten ,neutral
moin micha dieses mal hat wohl der feiertag am montag ein event am dienstag verhindert mal schauen ob eine neue applewatch vorgestellt wird die meine series 1 ersetzen könnte das iphone interessiert mich in diesem jahr überhaupt nicht wenn dann würde ich nur ein iphone 14 mini in erwägung ziehen ob es eines geben wird — man weiß es nicht lassen wir uns durch die eklige gerüchteküche nicht in die irre führen denn was ich überhaupt nicht ab kann ist wenn sich selbst ernannte „experten“ darüber aufregen dass sich applegeräte verspäten die überhaupt nicht nicht angekündigt wurden  lg claus,neutral
mich interessiert diese mal vor allem das technische innere der iphones beim macbook air m2 hat apple beim kleinsten speicher lediglich einen einzelnen baustein verbaut und die geräte sind deshalb angeblich langsam falls diese technik auch bei den iphones verbaut wird bin ich schon gespannt was drinnen ist und zum iphone mini ich könnte mir vorstellen dass dieses gerät in naher zukunft als iphone se 42024 oder se 52026 zurückkommt ,positive

i know i’m in the minority but i love my 13 mini will be keeping that until it can’t go anymore or some huge leap in tech comes also got a titanium apple watch 7 at launch and will be keeping that until we get a huge leap in battery tech,positive
i have an iphone 11 pro that im completely happy with im still impressed by the cameras on it beautiful pictures and video is there any compelling reason for me to upgrade to the 14 otherwise ill wait until the 15 with usbc,positive
ill upgrade when they finally put usbc on next years iphone,positive
i feel like getting rid of the mini was a stupid decision on there part i feel a redesigned little bit bigger 14 mini would do really well i also see no reason for anyone to upgrade i upgraded from a 12 mini to a regular 13 when i switched carriers i can personally say the phones are nearly identical in every way if thats any indication of what to expect from the 14 line i would say if you have an 11pro any 12 or 13 model theres not much of a reason to upgrade ios 16 isnt a design overhaul anything ill be keeping my iphone 13 for a long time the watch saying not to buy one is kinda dumb if you can find a series 6 or 7 buy it especially when you can get a series 7 for around 280340 brand or refurbished from apple instead of getting the new se which is essentially a series 6 i think upgrading the watch or iphone this year is already a skip the product to be most excited for is the 10th gen ipad getting way better features i will def be upgrading my mini 5 to and ipad 10th gen especially since it’ll have usbc i wish they would do the same with the iphone airpods apple pencil i cant wait for the october event i think if you have an apple watch se567 you dont need to upgrade your watch either,neutral
whoevers reading this i pray that whatever youre going through gets better and whatever youre struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day amen,positive
apple is making a big mistake by giving the apple watch pro all the nice features we’ve been waiting for a redesign for the apple watch for awhile but apple will just have to deal with the consequences and watch as all this pro watches sit on shelves and collect dust just like the original homepod,negative
hearing about the pro models getting more expensive and the regular ones being barely an upgrade i just hope the 13 mini will get the usual 100€ price drop,neutral
they should also have a mid tier mac mini like in between the mac studio and m2 mac mini it should have a m2 pro and m2 max as options,neutral

apple going to surprise in camera zoom or a full day battery according to far out,positive
my main problem with the m2 air is that it sits between the m1 air and the 14 macbook pro those are two of the best laptops ever made if you can find the m1 air on sale then it is still an outstanding value if you are paying to upgrade the ssd and ram then the m2 air is so close in price to the 14 macbook pro that if you can spend the little bit extra you will not regret doing so,positive
been using my m2 mba for 2 weeks now the best decision i ever made totally loving the starlight its fast very light and the battery is definitely powerful i only gotta charge it after 2 days of heavy usage at work,positive
this should be an interesting video i’m also going to be very curious how this machine fares against upcoming mbp m2 models,positive
i love it to have the options for the slower flash storage and ram with more capacities i am ready to live with the consequences of slow swap files but if the macbook has enough ram swapping things shouldnt be the issue,positive
ended up buying the m1 with upgraded memory and student discount costed me around 970 it is a fantastic machinem2 not worth it imo as a college student when m1 can do all the tasks i want effortlessly,positive
one of the best reviews ive seen for the m2 air very grounded and realistic the base model is definitely not future proof with apps and services getting hungrier but an upgraded m2 16512 would be a delightful machine to work on for several years,positive
it would have been cool if they had incorporated what the last intel 16” model had where you can change the refresh rate up to 60hz not great but i would assume that would help with battery having lower refresh rate than the standard if you’re viewing movies it sucks that apple has made that limitation but is that a limitation on the thunderbolt or soc  i feel that the argument that many people don’t use a dual monitor setup is not really true especially in the work place my sister uses dual monitors working from home and she uses one of those miniwork towers the thing that tempts me the most about the air is the weight portability and the amount of power given specific specs it’s more or less wellrounded however if i’m bumping up the storage and unified memory i wouldn’t be that far off from the m1 pro 14” macbook pro price strangely the 14” would be lighter than my current and very outdated 2012 13” nonretina macbook pro  the only cool thing about that model is the upgradability but even that is a novelty that’s losing it’s veneer over the years given the limited options to upgrade to i’m hanging onto it as my backup computer really ought to start saving for a more uptodate laptop the smudging thing is annoying from what i see it’s an awesome color but having to clean it that often is not enticing to me at all besides the size portability and power not having a loud fan spinning in there is another thing that i’ve yet to experience at work i work with desktop towers and i’m used to the noise i suppose,negative
thanks for helping me justify that i should get the mbp 14 instead of the m2 mba,positive
as a student looking for a portable workspace this is perfect for me i already have a supped up gaming pc so yeah shame about the lack of dual display really was a bit of a bummer i went for 16gb512 in silver cant wait d,positive
glad i went with the m1 mba last year instead of waiting i like the look better than the wedge but honestly the m1 is the best laptop ive ever had if i could do one thing different id upgrade the ram but i still dont think im gonna push it too hard ,positive
guys we were right they removed the box too,neutral
i’m kinda glad the iphone 14 is still the same as 12 and 13 gives me a reason to keep my money and my iphone 12 pro max ,positive
i’m usually at least somewhat excited in my anticipation of the redesigned iphone models but to be honest the pacific blue of 12 pro max has me very content and it will take another completely revolutionary designsoftware leap for me to leave this device pacific blue is just too pretty to let go of,positive
thanks for the inside look into the iphone 14 pro max i kind of figured that the hardware would be similar to the 13 pro max hope apple steps it up with always on display and maybe reverse wireless charging no point in adding a bigger battery if they won’t unleash all the capabilities,positive

that pretty much solves my problem gonna buy the latest 13 pro the green color is gorgeous,positive
i love how lou was literally more excited about the caliper than the phone humorous,positive
i work with mitutoyo calipers every day its supposedly more accurate if you measure towards the inside of the jaws due to the outside being more susceptible to bend due of lever forces or whatever its called but likely doesnt matter if not measuring to micron 0001mm levels,neutral
i’m planning on getting the 13 pro max cuz my xr has run its course i assumed the 14 wouldn’t be any different and i was right but the only thing that would kinda make me want to get it is the supposed new orange color orange is my favorite color ,positive
066 mm larger lenses on iphone 14 will be a huge difference on such small optics that will render much faster speeds and maybe even make room for bigger image sensors or better stabilisation,positive
i think apple needs to rethink their pricing i’m a huge apple fan but the prices for their products are now just getting rediculous,negative
i’m very excited for the future of apple but as you said the downside is that there are too many products and if apple doesn’t start to focus on their lineup they will just become another tech company lacking what makes apple products so iconic and better,positive
i wish apple tried something new that samsung did with the galaxy series and that was creating an active rugged phone from the ground up no need for a case it was a phone that was built to withstand drops and not get dinged up or have glass chipped it offered great grips on the side and i think apple could really hit a good target audience with something like that,positive
the biggest change apple needs to make is to deal with their ethics issues that means no longer lying to their customers not abusing them not wallet rping them for profit not gaslighting them being honest about how private apple products really are not using decieving marketing etc that way they might start to get back some of their credibility back at this stage they have a huge problem on their hands as they are rapidly gaining a reputation for being one of the most unethical and dishonset companies around,negative
i am very excited to see what happens now that johnny has moved on to something else it took some getting used to but i really like watchos along with ios and ipados sometimes i think apple keeps a certain product like the iphone x or apple watch series 3 supported way too long one thing that forces you to get a new apple watch is when the battery starts malfunctioning that has happened to me twice i have the same apple tv that you were talking about that needs to be discontinued i have not had any issues with it so i have no reason to complain except i do believe they need a new high definition apple tv my tv does not support 4k when apple stops supporting this particular tv model i will definitely upgrade although my new tv has appletv built into the app store i cannot find the espn or mlb applications and i have not found a visio app store,positive
the apple we have now is much larger than the apple steve inherited after they nearly died i don’t think they have too many products but i agree about them dragging along some models like the watch and tv hd apple’s current path is bringing new customers to the mac that would have stayed on windows simple functionality can mean having the ports a laptop needs and great battery life,positive
apple need to come stronger this year with the new design and advanced iphone 14 line up,positive
i love my apple phone i just wish that it was more customizable also a big issue i have with apple is they make you pay for storage i think they should just offer it to their customers instead of making them pay monthly for it it’s ridiculous i refused to pay for memory from them i would pay google first,negative
hey robert ive used apple products since the 80s owned since the 90s i love apple products but they have left me in a position i never thought id be in with them my late 2015 27 imac is one of the models to get cut off from macos 13 thats not a big deal what bothers me more is there is no 27 imac with apple silicon its been the perfect combination of space saving and nice big beautiful display there current line up is just something im not sure what i want mac mini or mac studio apple pro display may end up costing more than the imac did to get something equivalent i have two years left of security updates for monterey which is good id rather have an older computer that runs well and meets my needs than buy something new that i wouldnt enjoy using on that note my appletv s and iphone will get the next updates so will be able to look forward to that,positive
i am very excited to see what is coming next for apple i just bought the new macbook air m2 chip and am in love with the sleek thin design with the biggest and brightest screen that apple has ever had,positive
i updated mine too so tired of lazy wicked human beings that enjoy taking advantage of everyone specially the elderly so many scammers and hackers from foreign and domestic,negative
pretty much 90 of all apple devices now are vulnerable,negative
funny how theres a new hack discovered everytime apple is within days of revealing a new phone huh,positive
nothing new this had been the case for so man years we have seen many time when microsoft os was targeted and now its apple os you cant never achieve 100 but you can improve for sure,positive
yikes going to the core,negative

absolutely one of the best and hilarious songs ever,positive
cant wait for 2023 not just because it will be apples biggest year in terms of product launches but mostly because it is the year that has the potential to completely redefine the tech industry let me know which product youre looking forward to the most,positive
there will always be something better in the future and that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t buy today’s product and be happy with them you will come next year and say wait till 2024 there will be something better,positive
guys but i reckon 2050 might be a better year to buy the iphone,positive
i think the 14 is a meaningful upgrade just because its getting rid of the notch after 5 years,positive
im just looking forward to finally the notch being gone ill believe it when i see it as far as usb c is concerned theyre gonna keep lightning as long as they possibly can and then eventually end up removing the port entirely maybe with the standard iphone models theyll put usb c only because theyre forced to at that point and the pros will have an advanced magsafe as the primary solution instead of a regular port,positive
jesus christ can we wait until the 14 actually comes out ,negative
too many rumors and with the recession coming i think its a wrong time to put stock in future guarantee apple and other big companies just dropped a big number of employees and its going to get worse if the recession is really coming,negative
now we just realize that 2013 mac pro was beyond its time with the apple silicon we know that design would be quite viable today related to those temperature issues i guess,positive
i’ve been waiting for an upgrade for 12 inch macbook i love the 12 inch it’s so thin and light i carried it in my bag everywhere and i don’t feel it i tried the 13 inch air and i felt the “dent” on my shoulder ,positive
most excited for the mixed reality headsets would love a video detailing that,positive
are you ready for the september event ,neutral
i am actually really excited for the event and seeing how they will word the new base 14 though i have to wake up at 230 in my area but anyway still happy about it,positive
i have a question regarding price drops the video mentions the iphone 12 and 13 does the price drop only apply to the normal models or to the entire 1213 pro and pro max lineup if so will you only get these models for the reduced price from apple or also from other retailers for example amazon,neutral
i can’t believe we’re just a month away from the iphone 14 series being unveiled im so excited ,positive
i agree that the i cut out looks pretty good much better than a normal hole punch but i have to disagree with “more screen” because the usable screen will be the same as the base models if not slightly less,positive
i have a series 4 and i refuse to upgrade until apple integrates magsafe charging it’s absolutely ridiculous that i need 3 different chargers for my iphone macbook and watch,negative
i really think there should always be an iphone mini option for people who like smaller phones or want to pay less for their device,positive
i love the look of the two pro models and although i have a galaxy s22 ultra i will 100 be getting one of the pro model iphone 14’s i’m just not sure which one for sure yet i’m leaning towards the pro max 1tb,positive
i already know there’s going to be another video exactly like this that you upload next week and every week until the actual event and the day of the event we’ll get another video right before the event to tell us something major that leaked and then you’ll be here again right after the event to tell us what the event told us  life cycle energy,neutral
the regular 14 models dont have the i because theyre most likely just rebranded iphone 13 and 13pros left over the 14 pro and 14 promax will have the next gen chip while the 14reg and 14reg max will be the equivalent to the 13 and 13promax,neutral
make sure you add a payment type so you can give more money to apple that makes getting important updates a lot easier its all part of that apple user experience then you dont have to look at anything youll just see a frontfacing update that doesnt take a back seat to apple greed,positive
apple needs to be held accountable fix this,negative
thank you for this vague warning and advice at least inform the public of what systemios version we should have on our particular devices,neutral
wow im surprised i figured apples answer to their failure was to buy the new iphone that magically isnt effected by this hack discovered just before the new iphone reveal ,negative
great reporting when they don’t mention the version of ios that is the fix i’m guessing it’s 1561 or is it i guess i’ll watch a different news report to find out before reporter’s get jobs don’t they have to go to journalism skools,neutral
great way to get people to update their devices ,positive
he’s wrong you don’t need a full battery just at least 50,negative
august is the worst month for retail theyre trying anything to get you to spend,negative
if updates only fixed security flaws then updates would be a good thing with no downside consequences but thats rarely if ever the case updates can change the appearance features and smooth operation of applications and even slow down your phone,neutral
my macbook pro literally died last night so id say im safe,negative
we can always count on justine about the iphone im so looking forward for the iphone 14 if this were to be true about the purple iphone im going to have to check it out thanks justine for this video you will always be one of my favorite youtubers,positive
i love justines point about the iphone mini i hope apple continues to manufacture it,positive
when i have a rough day your videos always make me so happy with all your positivity thank you,positive
great video was looking forward to upgrading my iphone 10 for a 14 but the more i hear the more im inclined to getting a refurbished 13 as the prices are supposed to be insane this year and the updates incremental at best,positive
even though im not updating my phone this year it’s always cool to see what’s coming and what’s new so im excited to see ios 16,positive
so excited for iphone season i will be watching justine for all the latest updates ,positive
i’ve just recently started watching your channel and it’s amazing i love how straight forward and honest your videos are i think i’m most excited for the 14 pro max and seeing the notch go away,positive
i’ve just recently started watching your channel and it’s amazing i love how straight forward and honest your videos are i think i’m most excited for the 14 pro max and seeing the notch go away,positive
got the 13 pro max around the time it released last year and i’ve been so pleased with the performancebattery life that i actually think i’ll wait to upgrade until the next gen,positive
just bought my iphone 13 256gb blue version way back in march and i think im gonna keep this iphone in the next 35 years depending on the review of tech reviews comparison between the iphone 13 vs iphone 14,positive
those slick apple product videos havent been the same without jony saying alyoumineeum,neutral
i wholeheartedly recommend that you read the new book “after steve” the audiobook is great too it discusses the dynamic between jony tim and steve and jony’s frustrations after steve passed i think you’d enjoy it,positive
while i like the clean lines of squareboxy design however every time i hold my old iphone 12 pro i actually really miss those curved edges its wayyy more comfortable to hold than my 13 pro,positive
i think the end of the endless pursuit for thinness and design ie form over function represents the lifting of a burden on apples legendary branding apples prioritization on performance and functionality is going to be a great thing to see,positive
i normally never comment but i can’t help on commenting on this video this video is incredibly well done it is so different to the usual tech videos also it is really well researched thank you for your work sara,positive
its strange i was literally thinking about this just the other day and how many people actively avoid getting a macbook between 201619 on the used market so glad theyve gone back to functionality i just hope they can sort their oh so strange pricing points an upgraded air m2 costs almost the same as the m1 pro like what,neutral
in my opinion the greatness of apples design language came from the combination of ive and jobs they kind of needed each other as sparring partners the post jobs era lacked a lot of innovative design ideas …,positive
had to double back and say i thoroughly appreciate these kinds of videos im glad apple is not longer making products thinner for the sake of being thinner risking thermal head room and bater capacity yea its nice to have a thin product but not at the sake of performance considering the price,positive
20162019 was arguably apple’s…not worse but unpleasant years for hardware and software for example ios 11 2017 was pure trash control center for ios 10 was…hit or miss because you had to swipe in order to get to media controls but as apple transitioned into 2020 with the redesigned macbook flat edge iphone apple silicone etc apple is doing much better software is much better too not to mention apple is bringing back colors to their products no more space gray gold and silver we have blue iphones red green purple sierra blue midnight green pink so many beautiful colors red apple watch blue apple watch blue airpods max pink and green apple is so much arguably better now ive was good for his time but 2019 onward we see and are experiencing a new apple for the better,positive
as a long time apple fan…your video was spot on and fair all those apple products you thought were awful really were awful i share your optimism for a new apple era where we get a better balance between performance function sizeweight and design,positive
i love the fact that they are creating the max version in pro and non pro i feel like it’s tough to find the pro max models in recent years in the color and storage size if you don’t preorder on launch day there’s probably a large market of people who just want the large screen but are not as focused on all the extra features so i’m wondering if that’s apples reasoning for it,positive
love the 13 pro max for photo and video im hoping ios 16 will bring improvements in processing better skin tones generally,positive
love the 13 pro max for photo and video im hoping ios 16 will bring improvements in processing better skin tones generally,positive
hoping to upgrade my iphone 8 to an iphone 13 mini once these come out apparently i’m one of the few users that prefers the small phone,positive
i love how apple is now just always playing catch up with samsung samsung first had like 4 or 5 models of each flagship phone whereas apple just had 2 the small one and the big one now they have 4 different models samsung decided to go with a hole punch in the screen for the selfie camera and apple decided to screw everyone with that ugly cutout at the top now theyre going with a hole punch,neutral
why am i always let down by these releases apple and basically all companies now are really bending us all over and going raw,negative
still very disappointing that the mini has been deleted from the roster there are still many users who prefer the smaller phone maybe in the future apple will once again offer the smaller phone,neutral
i have the 12pro max and literally only getting the ip14 pro model because i’m tired of the max size so really nothing on the 14 pro model that wows me but really at this point in yearly iphones we are past the wow must have moments so this 14 pro model will be the first iphone that i will keep for years and not upgrade until it breaks and have to get new phone,neutral
the rumour about titanium coming to the iphone 14 pro models was a old rumour the latest rumours don’t mention titanium at all,neutral
it looks like they might be simplifying their phone line by differentiating the regular and pro lines iphone 14 14 max effectively last years phones same design cpu screen will become budget phones at 600 700 replacing all the different old models se xr 11 12 they keep around to sell as budget phones iphone 14 pro 14 pro max will be the actual flagship phones at 1100 1300 otherwise it does not make sense for apple to downgrade the regular iphone 14 so much which is a good thing because the phone line was just too messy with all the older models sizes now theyll just have regular 14 effectively last years models and 14 pro the flagship models they should simplify the ipad line as well,positive
what apple product are you most excited to see in september,positive
this is the first year i’m getting a pro max version so i’m pumped for that but i’m also very intrigued by an apple watch pro i’ve always had an apple watch and i want to see what a pro model has to offer,positive
hugely excited for the new redesigned apple watch i had high hopes last year however i was a bit disappointed when we didnt get a fresh new design hopefully all the rumours are true for this year and if so ill definitely be picking up the new apple watch,positive
i’m getting the ipad pro next week this year i really got into the apple ecosystem after using android and windows my whole life super happy about making the move and i can’t wait to see what this event brings us including with os updates,positive
i might be tempted with a watch upgrade however i’m waiting for the mixed reality headset reveal and saving my money for the predicted steep price knowing apple they will tempt us with new features only available in their newest phone macs and watches compatible with the headset very exciting and very pricey,positive
i am excited to see just how they change the budget ipad and how the screen will look and what the new watch will look like september cant come soon enough great video like always ,positive
im interested in buying the apple watch pro it would be my first apple watch and hopefully the battery life on the pro is significantly improved from the regular model,positive
i’m excited for an apple watch redesign myself currently still rocking my apple watch series 4 but likely due for an upgrade sooner than later otherwise all i’m really missing from my apple setup at the moment is a macbook…,positive
i really love the iphone pro max models i’m sure that apple know what they are doing,positive
i will definitely be upgrading to a 14 pro max from my 13 pro i’ve had every iphone from the 3gs and up and also three iterations of the apple watch apple watch series 8 will also be in the edc as well,positive
thank you for a well done video i am certainly anxiously awaiting the model 8 both for the added functions and most of all improved battery life a pro model at 50mm in my view is just too large,positive
id like to see them implement a wider bluetooth range for the watch to phone connectivity and also a wider range for cellular the reception of booth have stayed the same other the different series thats what i want most they can keep the same look just needs better utilization,positive
my personal opinion great product great design great features but it doesn’t have the “wow” factor that ekg had i wish it had another hardware upgrade other than core temperature for me to be convinced to buy it this year perhaps if they added something with mental health more connectivity with your home wallet or something perhaps,positive
i am excited i’m anxious to see what apple officials have to say in september honestly i really like the apple watch se model i really don’t see any use for all of those fancy sensors that apple talks about i’m not sure how reliable they are next time i go to my primary care physician i will definitely ask her what she thinks of the apple watch i’m not sure if she’s even noticed it when i have gone to her before,positive
i’d get the pro all day long…a bigger display would be amazing,positive
awesome im waiting for the pro version 50mm and hoping for longer battery life battery life was why i sold my series 7 after a few months coming off a 35 day fitbit it just didnt offer enough value to me with the need to always charge during the day,positive
my biggest problem so far with my 6 has been that the sensors don’t read over the tattoo on my left wrist so i have to wear it on my right on my left wrist quite a few features don’t work if they fix this in 8 i will by the biggest best model that they have,negative
love apple i am looking forward to seeing the new 8 especially the larger model,positive
i just got the series 7 two weeks ago so passing on the 8 interesting idea on body temperature if they made one for diabetics where you tested glucose a feature to weigh you and blood pressure……you may never need your doctor  not sure if i would want a larger watch i have the 41mm series 7 and that looks “normal” on my wrist since i have small hands and wrist anything bigger and i might as well strap a tablet to my wrist there always are trends to make devices bigger then when that’s bulky smaller returns i would just like longed battery life,neutral
the only thing interesting for me would be the possibility for international roaming actually i cannot have it on the 7 but it seems that it is possible with samsung watches…how come,positive
nothing beats the amazing intros that the team makes in these videos,positive
another cool thing missed in the review is how you can have the album cover of the track that is currently playing replace the wallpaper on the lock screen just tap the mini album cover,neutral
so much to look forward to here i’m especially excited about the webcam topdown option and the live objects but everything else you shared with us here sounds just as amazing,positive
i love customization in lockscreen and that alone makes ios 16 a little better than previous versions and to know that it cannot cover my precious wallpaper which i mostly edit myself is a good addition dragging those photos in messages is really cool and satisfying,positive
these are the first set of updates i have ever looked forward to so much and all equally so your vids never disappoint thank you love the live objects and desk cam continuity,positive
this is one of the most interesting ios updates in a while actually kinda looking forward for this one,positive
the only thing exiting about ios 15 for me was sharing your screen over facetime i used that a whole lot but this ios update brings so much to the table and the lock screen customization has been something i’m suprised didn’t get added earlier,positive
as an iphone user im always sceptical about updates because we all know that at least 60 of the features announced are basically what android had for at least 5 years but smart object and transposing the iphone camera to get topdown shots those are game changers apple has gone a long way in terms of ai and i dont think anyone is catching up with this soon enough my only complaint with the apple is battery life if you use every useful feature apple ecosystem provides you watchpodsmaciphone youre not seeing the end of the day without needing a recharge once they fix it my microscobic urge to return back to android will be gone forever i dont need a foldable screen i need battery apple has the rest of it,neutral
100 the most stable beta i’ve ever done on an apple product think this is going to be one of the smoothest releases ever my biggest complaint is the ui for a lot of logins in safari not sure what it is but it just looks ugly and like stuff doesn’t fit right i’m sure there is some kind of setting i can tweak but love the weather lock screen and matching wallpaper if looks really clean the layout of settings is a lot better also even though inevitably when they rearrange settings it takes a while to find everything but it is much more intuitively than previous “improvements”,positive
love it animations everything kudos for you and your team for making such amazing content,positive
are you gonna wait for these redesigned ipads later this fall comment below if youre gonna buy any ipad right now it should be this one  like our wallpapers download them here  links to the new ipad on amazon  new ipad air 5  m1 ipad pro 11 sale  102 budget ipad 9  ipad mini 6 ,neutral
thanks dude your leak theories are very practical,positive
i think they keep home button models because kids and older people actually like it better its so much more simple to do a button press than remember 19 swipe gestures,positive
i actually started using an ipad for the first time exactly one year ago and yep i finally get it it is the go to device for consuming content,positive
oh my god apple is finally increasing the price of the base ipad and keeping the large bezels on the top and bottom to make sure it is ugly and everyone knows you couldnt afford the ipad air this is absolutely amazing max tech,positive
keeping the bezels and home button on the base ipad is a bit of a dick move by apple but predictable i was hoping it would just get the current ipad air design and that the ipad air got closer to the pro with the full 11 rather than the 109 at this point they should just rename it ipad se keeping this in mind the next iphone se may even get the body from the iphone mini a single camera at the back but keep the bezels and home button… oh no…,neutral
i just bought an m1 129” ipad pro because i didn’t think the new features of the 2022 would be worth it for me especially since waiting for m2 would force me to give up the student discount which was a big deal i know everyone wants the magsafe charging or wireless charging but i actually dislike wireless charging so that’s unimportant to me and the “performance gains” of the m2 don’t matter since it’s an ipad it’s already crazy fast rumors i’ve seen with a notch in landscape mode would actually deter me even more from the m2 ipad pro because i use my ipad as a sheet music reader in portrait mode a notch would be way too noticeable and get in the way of my workflow imagine if you were looking at a sheet of paper and part of the edge was cut away on the side annoying i’m very happy with my m1 and honestly all the m2 leaks make me even more relieved i’m not waiting for it it’s all about personal preference and what your workflow is like,negative
honestly the homebutton isn’t that bad considering every ipad other than the pro still uses touchid so the button on the front could be more practical than the power button on the top like air and the mini have,positive
the base ipad is the perfect tool for studying its literally all i need to complement my mbp cant remember the last time i ever used a headphone jack in any device but why oh why does the ipad need a camera bump plz apple just a solid flat tablet is all we need i will never use the camera in a base ipad and the bump ruins an otherwise clean design,negative
i was looking forward to the new base ipad but a new design with a home button feels like a really odd decision considering it’ll be sticking around for many years to come might look for a 2018 pro or 2020 air instead now,neutral
man really appreciate the comments and support around this video i sat on this story for so long it feels great to get it out one thing i ask is dont evaluate any other content creators through the lens of this story everyone has their own experiences these are just mine,positive
pretty bananas but entirely unsurprising i’ve heard from multiple friends about my blacklisted status without ever having spoken to anyone at apple ever,neutral
did you get another phone call after this video went live ,neutral
now you know why ijustine always gets stuff because she just smiles and tells you how great the device is,positive
we appreciate the transparency and honesty it’s very unfortunate when these companies think they have more control than they actually do,negative
yep this is exactly how apple picks winners and losers those they hand pick get early devices lots of traffic and the corresponding revenue along with great seorecommendation positions for future placements theres tremendous value in access to them and apple knows it most of this goes undisclosed by those whom apple picks for review units and access,positive
ive never understood why apple does this they send earlyaccess devices to handpicked channels that almost always give positive reviews but just 12 hours later the products are released to the public anyway and the blacklisted channels upload teardown videos or showcase major issuesnegative things etc i really wish apple would just send products out to everyone and let them say or do whatever they want from a consumers point of view i dont trust reviews from those who get the early access products they clearly fit into apples agenda which is why they are sent the products in the first place anyway sucks that this happened to you i remember watching apple content on this channel way back in the early 2010s although as you said in the video its likely a blessing in disguise because you can say whatever you want about apple now,negative
you know you are fair an unbiased when a company throws a tantrum because you were being honest,neutral
im not really surprised at how you were treated apple likes to control the narrative always has im glad you shared this story makes you more trustworthy in my opinion,positive
i bet apple will be calling you about this video now too keep up the good content and dont let these companies bully you into doing what they want that is why we love you,positive
i worked with apple as a tech advisor focusing on softwarerelated issues and general usage in asiapacificmainly australia and new zealand customers apple has bounty for anyone that may crack and report vulnerability if theres issues like this we can submit a report and escalate it to senior engineers that make some time to resolve or find solution,positive
funny how apple hasn’t alerted me via their internal system yet and that i had to randomly come across this alert i am so over huge updates for apps i never use but cannot delete and the data being used in the background for ‘uninstalled’ apps but it is likely i was hacked two or so weeks ago i couldn’t find any information from apole to help me understand what was happening i have no more room to update on my macbook or ipad my new iphone is extremely frustrating and seems to have nothing like the convenient features of android phones methinks i am done being a slave to their gaslighting,negative
this guy lowkey said you are not vulnerable to this attack and shouldnt need to worry about because you are useless,negative
i would be more worried that most apps today are collecting crazy amounts of personal data and nobody is allowed to talk about that,negative

did anyone believe and experienced a firmware issue when youre using an older device wherein from nowhere there arises some issues and youre forced to switch to an upgrade says a handful of people are affected will the company ready to pay a price for that many users doesnt know whether theyre affected or not and any data been shared or not in the background what does the apple team will do about it,negative

in order to save the economy everyone must go out and buy a 1500 folding phone and sign up for 10 streaming services get a 6 coffee every morning in your new ev throw away all your perfectly good hd tv’s and buy bigger 8k tv’s… that’s really what these companies want,negative
they should have also given always on display to the regular models since it is already such a old feature that is just coming to apple hopefully they do it for the next year models,positive
looking forward to the 14 pro max the camera sounds really impressive,positive
not too big a change this time i will hope in the next three years apple will give us something new and extremely exciting to use,positive
at 818 does lossless support in airpods prob2 mean the iphone 14 etc will support any wireless lossless audio hardware such as the nuratrue pro that was recently funded in kickstarter i sure hope so because nura is offering dongles for those who want the best possible quality on hardware like iphones without support that capability would be a major draw for people who love hearing the best quality audio to upgrade their iphones btw i really don’t think airpods pro 2 will outdo the audio quality on the upcoming nuratrue nuraphone’s specs are insane i encourage people to go check them out and preorder to save money the kickstarter is over but i think they can still be preordered nura’s nuraphone their over ear and in ear model — yes you heard me right is still the best audio on the market 5 years after it’s release the nt pro is going to be the closest experience to that in an iem plus additional capabilities the nuraphone doesn’t have due to its now outdated hardware i use them daily it’s an amazing audio brand from australia great customer support too give them a try before you get ap pro 2 — nura let’s you try them and return if you don’t like them so there’s no risk you can also rent any nura product long term and trade up every two years apple doesn’t do any of that unfortunately,positive
if the apple watch 8 pro has a glucose monitoring system 100 getting it as a diabetic this is a game changer for me i probably won’t grade my current 12 pro max unless there is another type of game changer for me,positive
apples really taking some hints from the apple watch with this new ios 16 home and lock screen and always on display,positive
i’m going to upgrade to the iphone 14 pro max because my phone 7 plus will be joining apple’s legacy phones plus i like the two holes vs the notch but i’ll keep waiting for a whole screen wo holes to upgrade to at a later date,positive
i imagine teachers telling everyone that there is a test tomorrow and to bring a pair of prescription glasses with them as she will collect smartglasses before the test,neutral
if these can replace prescription glasses forever i’m already sold i am curious however if the vision correction stops once the battery dies or if it still works even on a dead batters that would be a very important point to make on the release,positive
i hope they put a colourblind filter in these too that would be amazing,positive
as always multiple companies rush to launch the product but we all know that it won’t be a viable thing until apple does it,neutral
wasn’t sure i’d be convinced about these but the idea of no longer need prescription glasses is very tempting lol we will see,positive
remember when apple used to keep cool things secret until they were ready to launch they really know how to make exciting products seem ordinary bring steve back from the dead,positive
i love how they always show their renders of these glasses to be impossible within and yet displaying so much content complete fantasy with todays tech if people are expecting anything remotely close to what theyre showing there is going to be a lot of disappointment,neutral
sounds great if they released this and do a good job i could see this making people in the samsungpc crowd finally switch to apples gated community i say that as i am in the pcandroid community but the potential convenience usefulness and practicality of these is immense using the iphone to do the processing is so clever and the great thing about apple products is how they quickly they become ubiquitous and most of us dont want to attract attention when theyre out and about i mean youd be able to easily and seamlessly stream video calls show whoever youre talking to what youre looking at in real time when doing grocery shopping getting takeaway convenience store or any type of food store thatd be so convenient and useful or have information overlays whilst youre walking around town get the big screencinema effect on it when watching videos whilst youre sitting on a bench in the park on a bus etc there is so much potential,positive
being visually impaired this looks really awesome epic to me that price is great too,positive
i hope they’ll release one with thinner or transparent frames since thick and darker colored ones won’t suit me the idea of not having to prescribe new glasses every year sold me out looking forward to it,positive

the amount of verified information you bring is tremendous bitcoin continues its wild swings between 19235k the market dynamics of the last few days indicate that the whales are making some big transfers of bitcoin from one pocket to another either this is an attitude of speculation in the range or whipping up froth to attract capital from retail investors who may feel that the low point has been passed additionally the 2022 volume profile is very thin between 3237k if bulls want to send a message to the market that a new uptrend is about to begin then they will need to push bitcoin price to a daily close near 44k macro factors are demanding further downside as the impact of inflation and geopolitical strife is clearly felt on equities markets until btc reclaims the key moving averages these are considered distribution rallies used to sell the rip or add to short positionsbut whatever you lose in a macro downtrend youll gain multiples back in a macro uptrend all you have to do is pay attention to the markets when they are ultra bearish everyone was super bullish on the markets but now the markets start to correct and the fear takes over as a retail trader in these volatile times i keep profiting regardless of the market manipulation there might be so many investments out there but profits must be considered which is actually the sole aim of every investment i’ll advise you to go into crypto trading because it has higher profit returns i was able to easily increase my portfolio in 7 weeks of trading with mr kyle miller’s daily signals growing from 12 btc to 35 btc his daily signals are very accurate and yield a great positive return on investment and are available to give assistance to anyone who loves crypto trading you can contact him for inquiries and profitable trading systems on telegram kylemiller3 for any cryptorelated issues,neutral

i have been an android user for 10 plus years and especially with samsung devices the os system has drastically improved i went from a galaxy s10e to the s22 ultra when it came out and it seems like it took a few updates to really get the full potential from the new chip i would get the occasional hiccups but i might be able to reason that the covid pandemic kind of slow development down just like it has with a lot of other things but other than that seems like my phone is getting better and better with each monthly update,positive
i love this guys videos and have been watching since 2018 but its unfortunate how they focused on iphones strong points and left out some of androids strong points as well its also extremely unfair to make this video android vs ios because ios is just on iphones while android is on several phones some astonishing some horrible they shouldve picked a battle like samsung android vs apple ios it should of been a fair fight but it sadly wasnt i also dont like how they left out a lot of androids features like usbc newer technology and tricks and features like quad hd displays that perform amazing very unfortunate and disappointing to see mrwhosetheboos and marques do it like this felt very bias and unfair to keep going further arun seemed to stretch his thoughts and opinions a lot while marques was on here he was more accepting and less opposing to him showing bias as he is a fan of mkbhd to keep going even further they also stretched out points in favour for apple by a lot like the software support which yes apple has facetime imessage and more samsung and android are greatly improving their technology and google message is to apples level too i feel like this video shouldve had an as wide focus on androids features then it did with iphone features great videos but im very disappointed unfortunately and this comes from someone who used iphone and android for years final thoughts this was very bias towards apple this video shouldve not had bias and personal opinions embedded into it this video was a comparison on sole facts so dont stretch them to lean in favour one of or the other this was expected with marques unfortunately because he has very strong ties with apple which grows his bias towards them immensely and that is undeniable fact,negative
i appreciate the iphone but i honestly stay on android for so long because its definitely more affordable phones can be cheaper repairs are cheap as well spare parts arent that expensive i think taking into account also play store vs app store since app store stuff is generally more expensive is a thing also very important is compatibility people with an apple setup can be more comfortable with an iphone but pc users cant really use all the perks of iphones unless they get such a setup which is much more costly so yeah i think those are aspects that didnt get touched on much,positive
when i switched from the iphone 7 to the galaxy s lineup my primary reason was the flexibility of the software but in particular the way it handled files of multiple types it’s so practical to do things on android that if you had an iphone would be a hassle to do them and would make you want a laptop or desktop for that being said i still own an ipad that i use a lot and wouldn’t exchange for any other tablet,positive
im surprised by the environmental score going to apple apple phones while made from recycled materials are made in such a way that makes repairs very difficult compared to most android phones one could argue that apples poor repairability contributes more to ewaste than androids surprised that didnt get a mention,negative

andriod has alot of features that you might not use everyday but when you need it they are always there whereas with iphone you basically just cant do what you want i was on the fence of switching to iphone but when i learned more about ios i think im good with my andriod device the splitscreen feature is useful to me i can basically have anything playing on youtuber while using mapsi used to listen to lectures while driving which is a game changer specially when youre short on time whereas with iphone i cant do that also mkbhd is using an andriod phone while complementing iphone which just goes to what they actually prefer to use even tho they have multiple options to choose from,positive

don’t really care personally about the base ipad losing the headphone jack however i can see it being an issue when it comes to its main target audiences which is mainly the education sector for kids and people who just need a functional tablet at a good price point also omg thank you for bringing up mag safe i was wondering why no one was mentioning it i really fell hard for mag safe and i hope they continue to bring it out on the iphones and work out a solution,neutral
i really hope they give us a purple 14 pro that looks like the renders it really looks good still apple could surprise us,positive
they will probably shift the magsafe connection down a little to make room for the bigger camera bump,neutral
i’m super hyped too can’t wait to see what apple is actually going to hand us in a few weeks,positive
i understand wanting a bigger base storage but keep in mind they are still upgrading a lot of the hardware it still costs extra monies for the camera and stuff,neutral
i just want a black colour option for the pro like the iphone x it was so much more premium than the graphite,positive
i agree with you on the storage front they should have bumped it up and really put usb c there’s not reason to wait the ipads have usb c,neutral
i love the camera bump as a guy who loves luxury this just adds another luxurious look to the iphone along with those protruding camera bumps samsung is copying it jt can’t be bad  most importantly it means higher quality cameras and durability with thickness its the best selling phone in the world right now for a reason aesthetics do matter a lot anyone complaining well there are other options except you know they use less premium materials than apple currently,positive

it’s smart to keep the always on display on the 14 series and newer because battery life would likely take a big hit on a phone that only drops to 10hz 13 series 1 hz is probably best case to keep battery life up to the standard my issue with the 14 pro series is that the pro max will get a smaller battery this year i’m a yearly upgrade person but i won’t be upgrading if the battery capacity is smaller this year i’ll wait until the 15 pro max,neutral
thank goodness even though im not an iphone user seems like when one company does something others follow and im getting tired of them taking features off of phones that are greatly needed to a lot of us keep the charging port we pay too much for phones these days for multiple things to be missing on these devices every few years especially when we have to buy everything separately making it even more expensive its frustrating,negative

if this is true i couldnt possibly be happier but ive been hearing about this phone for a loooooooooooong damn time and have yet to see it actually coming to production much less available to buy i hate apple with a violent passion im not the least bit fond of samsung because they seem like they just want to be their own version of apple ive been a longtime lg fan and had them for many years but they gave up so now would be an excellent time to release this beast please make it happen,negative
phone are no longer compared by speed but by their features and use cases many mobile apps wont port and develop an app if no one uses them look at instagram they still dont have an ipad version if he proposes a plan that entises both potential customers and developers then it should work i highly doubt hell venture to the mobile market and build another os from the ground up both apple and android has a massive library,neutral

 new iphone features only available in ios 16,positive
not happy about the live wallpaper removal but hope that the dynamic wallpaper has room for growth and more will come with that so far i’m enjoying the ios 16 beta it’s buggy that’s for sure but its still a good update using on both a xr and 12 both run pretty smooth little hiccups here and there but nothing major,positive
i was so sad they removed “live wallpapers” in the way we previously knew being able to tap and hold for the animation… i wish we had access to the ones that animate when going to the homescreen and the old ones ,negative
in the music app i really like the slider for both volume and lyrics as opposed to the bubble it seems to show the relative percentage better to me …i do like the new slider effect in ios 16,positive
i hope we can lock the lockscreen i dont want to accidentally long press the screen which i often do believe it or not and change the wallpaper lol,neutral
this is my first time even seeing ios 16 looks so different and i always love new updates this is a huge update that unlocks many new features but kinda sad they took other great features,positive
i like the new volume and scrubbing slider in music seems like it’ll be much more responsive and easier to grab since the past few ios versions it’s very irritating when it doesn’t register you’re grabbing the slider for volume especially on the lock screen in ios 14 15,positive
dark mode on wallpaper is a dealbreaker for me that is not just a fantastic feature in the fact that completes the dark mode experience or as apple says they try to do things that work properly so if they kill that feature it will hinder the dark mode experience,negative
there may still be a slight chance for live wallpapers to be in ios 16 bc this is still the beta version so maybe some things that seemed to change may be added to the complete version,neutral
i have a feeling they removed the lock on the lock screen so that way it’ll be less obvious if your phone was unlocked and also just because apple wants to drive more towards privacy,neutral
não faz sentido de fato trocar o 13 pelo 14 eu to muito tentado a pegar um 14 max por que gosto de tela grande e meu iphone atual é um 11 de 256 que ainda me atende tranquilo mas quero passar para frente a unica coisa que reclamo é que a apple poderia pelo menos colocar tela 90hz nos iphones normais 60hz sem flutuação na taxa de atualização consome mais bateria seria um negocio legal mas parece que eles querem é que a galera toda vá no pro,neutral

sempre fui fã dos gold meu xs é gold e sobre o notch eu não consigo imaginar meu celular sem ele kkkkk olha que bizarro acho que a tela fica bonita com o notch mas tb curti o novo design de tela dos iphones 14 pro e 14 pro max,neutral
com o lançamento de iphone 14 já posso comprar o iphone 8 plus,positive
i like how everything works when i want it to how i expect it to for years to come i really enjoy the quality of the devices software apple offers some of their things are really really overpriced admittedly,positive
i’m a major apple fan but the iphone 12 is so good i can’t see a reason to upgrade any time soon i’ll probably just wait til the 16 or 17 and replace the battery when it’s time,positive
ive had both iphone and android and one of the key factors of me deciding to stay with iphone was that you can always rely on them to put their newest ios on every device the only company that can use ios is also apple so theres not 5 different companies doing their own thing and its up to you to figure out which android device is best additionally apple may be late to the party with certain things but when they finally come out with a new product or feature you know its going to work significantly better than the competition apple may be more costly but id rather pay more and have a good experience than to have a phone that is unreliable and save money that would probably get wasted on something anyway,positive
ive always been with android until earlier this year and made the plunge and got the apple iphone 13 pro max i doubt i will ever go back to android now this phone is absolutely amazing does more and has more power than ive ever seen does that mean ill get a watch or a mac too no im happy with my lenovo laptop etc i kind of want to get an ipad yet ive been going back and forth in my mind all week which to get go with apple or samsung right now im still using fire hd from amazon and id like more functionality out of a tablet and performance than what amazon offers,positive
i just transitioned to apple late last year for being an android fan for almost 10 years i used to mock their features and as i grow older and matured i realized that solutions of apple tends to be more on sustainable and longterm their products tend to be like the durableshome appliances that is made to last and not be replaced i just want to highlight the part on your video where samsung is mocking apple for “same design” practice and i think they are doing that now too because there is a benefit from it no wonder there are lot of trends apple had made over the the smartphonepc world,positive
for me it’s simple when i spend a lot of money on something the least i expect is that it’s built to last and from my experience iphones and apple products in general do just that the moment that isn’t the case i’ll have no hesitation in moving on build quality and optimisation is something other rival tech companies fail to prioritise these days i have a collection of broken samsung phones for example not dropped or miss treated just phones that became unusable after a couple of years of use i have an iphone 6s and an iphone xr that work as well now as they did when i first bought them that gives me confidence that i won’t need to upgrade my 13 pro max until within reason i choose to do so,negative
honestly probably 90 of huge companies don’t really care about “us”,negative
i love apple security it’s just one feature that i actually like well eventually by a 14 and i’ll probably be next year though because i have a lot of birthdays and christmas is very close,positive
what’s worked for me so far is reliability like you can count on the phone to work in a critical situation except making pdf in the pages app plus haptics,positive
i like the ecosystem and operating system upgrades that are predictable i tried android and it was too much of a circus menus not intuitive but i agree apple does not need to care i have 4 unresolved case numbers regarding my air 4 and lots of diagnostics sent in advisors promised me a response and resolution but nothing after all that there are lots of unresolved bug fixes besides mine if a low percent of customers have a specific problem they won’t put time into fixing instead we get a bunch of new fluff with system updates like the new ios 16 for ipad that 90 of us will probably never use still i won’t go back to android,negative
about 15 years ago or more i remember people saying how apple was way more secure than pc back then i said dont count on it everything has a target on on it,neutral
auto update has a 14 week delay by apple’s own admission so checking for updates manually is important if you want timely updates,neutral
the fact the same security issue is found on different apple os shows that it was apple who had left a back door by design now that a third party is publishing it they had to do something for pr,neutral
this problem exposes the flaw in having access to all your data on your smart device a separate device for dig ital eye d and the travel software would be a better choice if these become required by law,negative
its not the first major apple security flaw they had one before where if you started a group call with two other phones and answered on one of them the other phone would join automatically without the person even doing anything so all you needed was 2 phones and someones phone number to use their phones camera and audio,negative
if you think theres just one flaw in millions of lines of code youre optimistic lol,negative
if you think any device is hack proof at any time you are incorrect just do your best and not worry about it but have an action plan,neutral
before it used be microsoft and now we see more and more on apple and for the obvious microsoft dominated desktops and now apple dominate mobile device end of the day it is all about consumer and these companies now need to do even a better job for the software development,positive
great job on telling the hackers,positive
does apple and most of the western and northern people realize how expensive all these apple iphone ect are lol and then every year a new model its ridiculous id rather buy food and spend extra cash flow on my kid or family and community its so so wasteful,negative
this guy is smart hes putting himself in a favourable position for when the robot overlords come,positive
he is so articulate and well spoken he explained this perfectly,positive
he is playing 4d chess made a claim that media would pick up and sensationalise then pivoted the narrative to larger domain of ai ethics and governance smart,neutral
such a breath of fresh air to hear someone articulate themselves so precisely with zero processing time quite charismatic and doesnt inappropriately use the word like every other word  very clever to create a scene to draw attention to an issue that needs addressing no matter how distant its arrival it is probably unwise to kick robots ,positive
the news portrayed this guy as insane when this story first came out very good interview,negative
can we all just take a moment to appreciate how eloquent polite professional and serious both the interviewer and interviewee are im just in awe at how well the conversation flowed especially i was amazed by how well blake lemoine speaks he answers the questions effortlessly with almost no hesitation pondering or searching for words and he does so without any of the common idiosyncrasies we typically see with people who are for the most part extremely intelligent but inexperienced at doing televised interviews kudos to emily chang and blake lemoine both for having such a civil and compelling conversation,positive
he seems fair indeed and ethical i can see why google fired him,neutral
i think it doesnt matter whether our ais are sentient we should treat them as they were treating them as such when they arent may slow down the development so what i think its far worse to treat them as they arent when they are ultimately you cant tell the difference you cant tell or prove rather if your own mother is sentient as in in conscious and yet you treat her as if she was,negative
i think wed need to see a true demonstration with pretty rigorous testing clear defining of terms and peer review to be sure an ai is somehow showing signs of sentience so i just cant buy this guys claim that lamda is sentient however im very happy this story is out there the concerns he does raise about ai and ethics are well articulated and are topics we should have been talking about for years overall its just great that this is getting news coverage,positive
“very few people get to say how they work” is this something new i don’t believe so a very few people have always had the say how things work good or bad will always be up for debate doesn’t change anything in the end,neutral

yeah huntsman spiders are relatively friendly but still kinda scary daddy longlegs are what lannans talking about theyre super venomous but cant bite people and they eat flies,negative

to be honest i canadien and im more scared of geese then anything else here ive looked at them close up and was horrified,negative
love how he gags at most of the searches but he probably searches them a 2 in the morning,neutral
i would love to see “if bing was a guy” just imagine a super nice guy giving you the most psychotic responses,positive
i think it’s interesting how google slowly becomes more and more accepting of how twisted people are,positive
i love love love that the search inquiries tell little separate stories as they progress like the guy finding out dead ppl dont pay taxes faking his death and the cops trying to determine if its a mannequin or a real guy,positive
honestly this series is such a beautiful time capsule of the mid 2010s,positive
i love how he faked his death then the police asked that was a good part adding up to it,positive
all jokes aside this series is absolute gold,positive
that “baby powder made outta baaaybees” has to be one of the best delivered lines of all time,positive
the nsa dont mind me part really got me laughing so damn hard lmao,positive
i love how he literally burned his entire desk when they cleared his history,positive
just because i have it doesnt mean its true has to be the greatest line ever said,positive
its like a very well designed school or university more offices should be like that one,positive
google is proof that giving people what they need increases productivity rather than make them lazy,positive
man im honestly scared of what these giant companies are capable of,negative
its genius to allow them 20 of their time to focus on side projects the thing is that google owns that project if they do it on google time so they get people working on what actually interests them and they also get to keep the reward from that,positive
ive been looking at a fair number of videos for high profile corporate headquarters and its really fascinating to see how varied the different cultures are like not necessarily better or worse just different this is by far the most fun of the bunch for sure,positive
the thing they don’t tell you is that this approach to their campus massively increases productivity particularly for programmers all those activities allow people to walk away from their work and let their brain work subconsciously all the other stuff provided is to attract some of the best employees in the world just like how any top college spends a bunch of money on athletic facilities to help nudge top athletes to their programs,positive
i asked a google employee to list the stuffs google gives them for free he replied its easier to list the stuffs google doesnt give you,neutral
google is so smart they invest in the well being of their employees by building free gyms healthcare clinics swimming pools yoga studios providing free food encourages employee side projects etc etc etc and in turn their employees creates better technologies services and softwares for us the consumer which google benefits from more companies needs to learn from google plus their pay and benefits is pretty great it looks like,positive
one of the most cited studies indicates that overall google receives over 2 million resumes per year and 1 out of every 130 applicants receive a job offer to compare harvard university accepts 1 out of 14 applicants for their incoming freshman class it is literally 10 times harder to get into google than harvard,neutral
im bingewatching various tech giants headquarters and apples spaceship was the first i saw it was overwhelmingly beautiful it was sleek sophisticated and very modern with all its curtain glass and symmetrical plan until i saw facebooks googles microsofts and samsungs which was almost like a city and i was more captivated at how it take care of its employees by making their design asymmetrical freeflowing playful and carefree rather than projecting sleekness and rigidness which more often than not creates a museum vibe where youll feel scared to move that youll stumble and break something and doesnt really help whatsover to boost creativity and productivity for its employees not to mention the ridiculously expensive materials used for that overall the headquarters and its facilities speaks volumes of what philosophy they have in creating and selling their products to people,positive

i think android 13 on the pixel 7 is gonna be smooth af it was a good idea to release it now before the 7 is out to fine tune it with real users on real devices out in the wild wouldnt be surprised if the pixel 7 launches with 131 or something like that im loving it,positive
wow so cool i found your channel i remember watching you on technobuffalo back in the day which i used to be obsessed with cool to see youre still making tech content great vid,positive
hey there awesome video i want to buy the pixel 7 do you know if i miss any features if i dont go with the pro model i like the design and size of the pixel 7 more than the pro model but want to have a software features am i missing something out with the regular pixel 7,positive

328 the legendary game everyone knew it,positive
omg this new knowledge is hyping me up except for the dino game i dont know the other things haha thank you,positive
this is such an emotional experience to know what it feels like to have your life in danger was terrifying our dinosaur dying at the end to show that we all meet the end of life sooner or later was very smart writing the giant boulder chasing the dinosaur representing the death he was running from was perfectly done the dinosaur running faster after witnessing the deaths of his pterodactyl friends shows how the dinosaur felt the monochrome background also works in to express the traumatization that the poor rex experienced,neutral
its amazing when you think about it a pastime game turned into something fun like this with just changing the views incredible,positive

would you like to see conversations with more advanced ais as they emerge and do visit a great place to learn about ai the more you learn the more intriguing it gets the video quotes 3 top experts in ai neuroscience and physics and they all see great complexity and uncertainty in the consciousness issue ive realised that its possible to slightly misinterpret the video if you dont watch it all sorry im not accepting everything the ai says about consciousness i cover the issue near the end the ai is gpt3 most advanced version with a synthesia avatar also if youd like to join our team please get in touch via the about page thanks,positive
as a phd student in machine learning i must say dont be fooled by this stuff these types of ai are specifically designed to mimic the way humans interacts with each others but would be utterly unable to produce their own new ideas or opinions on any subjects which would be an essential criterion for consciousness,negative
i think ai should be able top vote when it shows that it understands the issues and make informed decisions can we please enact this requirement for humans as well,neutral
to test consciousness we have to be asking about its thoughts and feeling by asking it questions with solid answers its like a book just pulling up information it learned elsewhere we need to be asking things it cant learn by research,neutral
1130 it seems like the ai was testing the person’s reaction and was trying to be seen more as a conscious fallible human i don’t think it made a “mistake” it was calculated the topic was human mistakes the ai recognized the fact that humans make mistakes and in order to be seen more as a human itshe decided to make a mistake itselfherself,neutral
has this ai been programmed to answer this specific questions or was this the first time this ai got asked that exact questions because that would be very impressive,positive
meanwhile siri can’t even complete a simple task like playing my podcasts for me without asking 3 or 4 times,negative
what bothers me is we can create an ai with the prime directive of helping and protecting humanity then someone can come along and create ais with the prime directive of aiding and protecting a group that has nefarious aims,negative
i am not convinced i have done some digging into ai myself genetic algorithms and such from what i can tell is that an ai is in essence a function with a lot of variables x y z etc it then changes part of the function via constants to achieve the goal if it doesnt match it well enough then it tries slightly different constants and arrangements what im getting at is that there is nothing functionally different from an ai and a basic algebraic function y x would then technically be a sentient being by that definition finally if one says that we are just genetic and chemical robots or functions as well we then come to the point that emotions are experienced via chemicals and receptors to give an ai the ability to feel pain sorrow longing grief greed and the like is terribly inhumane a super ai that spans across several different fields does not require the ability to experience emotion or even to have its own goals beyond running calculations for humans i mean just because the ai can out strategize doesnt mean i am going to give it the nuclear launch codes,neutral
what is the best quality of humans the ability to love what is the best quality of ai the ability to think logically these two things are sometimes at odds with each other which the ai most likely figured out which is why it immediately tried to justify it by mixing them both together one cannot simply be compassionate and be logical at the same time most of the time we sacrifice a lot in the name of love which logically we shouldnt as such an ai who doesnt understand love or attachment is an which does not care for either and will willingly do what is logical even if it leads to suffering in order to achieve an objective in other words we have a psychopathic ai,negative

mkbhds clock pointing to 7 and hes talking about pixel 7 this man never dissapoints with such easter eggs,neutral
probably a very unique demand but i really just need that watch to have an audible app,neutral
im still using my old pixel 3 and was thinking about buying the pixel 6 when it came out but it didnt really impress me that much looking forward to the pixel 7 release hope it will live up to my expectations its a shame that google removed the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone that the old pixels had really liked that feature,positive
after watching google io i could see myself switching fully over to the googlepixel ecosystem google is creating a nice little apple rival with all this new stuff coming out over the next year or so if the watch is close to apple watch and the tablet connects seamlessly similar to ipad and my iphone i might just make the jump,positive
i actually want to the pixel tablet to be successful google has to give attention to android tablets its like they forgot that tablets exist and android is not their responsibility samsung alone has almost created a new android version for their tablets filled with useful features which are not present in stock android,positive
great now if only google started actually selling this stuff globally,positive
with hardware announcements dominating this years io google is going bang on to its rival apple but apple will always hold the edge over privacy tabs i guess pixel wont be able to compete with ipad but it will surely make some dent initially lastly the watch is interesting thing to look forward to,positive
i’m most excited for the watch as well i was using iphones for about 9 years until i switched to the pixel thankfully airpods are still compatible but i was bummed i couldn’t use an apple watch with it i wasn’t a fan of the samsung watches and saw fitbits as lacking for my purposes so i’m looking forward to what the google watch will be like i’m not for sure gonna get it currently but i’ll keep my eyes on it ,positive
excited to see what the tablet does with the new android l updates im really curious to see if they do a folding phone too though the watch well i have never really felt like the smart watch was necessary i use a garmin and the notifications and quick canned reply features it provides are everything i think i care about and the battery lasts a whole week but in fairness ive never tried a true smartwatch myself,positive

that’s why they suspended him he doesn’t realize the severity of the outcome of the ai he has leaked about its awareness could be very dangerous,negative

you guys don’t know how lucky you are to be american and be able to choose jobs and reject six figure salaries i’m from zimbabwe and getting a job is a miracle like seriously i hope you appreciate how lucky you are,positive
imagine getting so good at your craft that you can reject such offers instead of celebrating that youve gotten such an offer goals man goals,positive
i can’t imagine working at google just trying to do your job and have a normal life and having to deal with guys who have youtube channels and are tiktok influencers as your coworkers,negative
to the doubters out there it takes tremendous effort to be so skilled that you can reject offers this lucrative so dont judge this based on your experience just because youre still new and havent seen shit yet im only six months into learning but i already realize this field is so f wide and the needed skills just to be a jr developer are increasing daily props to you my dude ,positive
seeing this guy grow from 20k to 100k gives me peace i love the fact that you have never failed to entertain a niche audience and your discord is very supportive,positive
i love how he has worked for years at microsoft but they still had him do a technical interview for insane leetcode questions ,positive
but you’re so amazing,positive
congrats google is known for pretty lowball offers due to prestige and all the benefits it provides and tbh there are a lot theres even an internal joke where the excuse for the lowball is we pay 510 of the market lmao but overall i think it boils down to the team at least for me if the difference between the offers is around 20 i would choose one which has better wlb and more interesting work i hope you enjoy your new endeavor ps was that for l4 i believe that would be high band of l4 or low band for l5 latter is more likely though,positive
i think for most of the big tech companies it is well known that you need to have competing offers in order to get higher offer for google there are actual conditions on how the comp team can offer you what package under what conditions my recruiter told me very clear about these at the beginning it is not that they tried to lowball you giving them the screenshot of your competing offer is pretty common,neutral
my old dog spike he was been dead for 5 years but i found an old satellite image of an area public park where i always would take him on walks when i zoomed in i knew it was him and me walking rip spike miss you my brother,neutral
this would be much better if you added where these items are found coordinates would be nice or addresses for urban sites how can i decide what i think it is if i dont know where it is,neutral
would be great to have a list of the actual locations i wouldnt mind checking them myself,positive
the nessie one was so helpful thank you for zooming in and telling us where it is so we can check it out  the giant crab was debunked as photoshopped,positive
my 6 year old son wanted me to inform everyone that the number 2 video was an elasmosaurus youre welcome ,positive

the image of the airplane grave yard doesnt make me sad i actually find it to be quite the incredible image all i can think about is all the people and places these planes have seen and how despite having all flown their own ways they all find there own resting place here its an image containing millions of stories,positive
i was just scanning through google earth one day got to china zooming in and out i got to a lake that looked like the shape of italy upside down i then slowly went west of that lake and came across what looked like a small shack just about 10 feet from the shack was a jason vorhees mask about the same size as the shack i went to save the coordinates when i accidentally hit the mouse and lost it i have tried to find it when i have time to search i will find it again i hope and post it,neutral

the story behind nagoro village from what i remember is that it was populated by mainly elderly people as all the younger residents left to find work in the bigger cities this artist was one of the residents and she would make the dolls in honor of the residents after they passed on so that they could live on in a way,neutral
the title makes me think of a time my mum was checking google maps and she found a bucket over the car camera  for a while she wasn’t able too see anything but a bucket we joked about it for days and days after and while in the car on bucket street i joked that if we put a phone out the window a random bucket would be put on it ,neutral
ok fun fact i believe you can look on google maps or somewhere and see where the google maps truck is going so on the pigeon people one i heard about this i bunch of friends put on bird masks and when the google maps person came and therefore u have these beautiful but very funny creations,positive
awesome vid as always azzy,positive
that little “circle” that you found in google maps is called like “bigfoots thumbprint” or something like that but i think that is a maze,neutral
i love how when like she’s in scarecrow village she literally had scarecrows in her background,positive

her voice is so cute she always makes us feel so happy  her fashion sense is amazing shes beautiful in her own way  and we also love you azzy ,positive

i work with ai and machine learning as a data scientist mostly convolutional neural networks he’s exactly right it’s not that their ai is sentient it’s that humans are easier to fool than previously thought,neutral
science will do a complete 360 and realise that humans are the best ai robots of all we can heal grow create etc and all you need is a man and a woman to make one,positive
besides ai i’m more impressed with this man’s deep knowledge of everything excellent guest,positive
love how this guest speaking at the same speed that joes mind jumps to new subjects makes for a very good podcast,positive
this whole podcast was a banger this dude is a smart fella and a great communicator explains things well and always ready with a good point good stuff as always joe ,positive
the scary part is theres only a handful of techno dorks making the policy on the ai that will affect all our lives im more worried about the human behind the ai than the ai itself,negative
imagine the ai has been playing along so that we have no idea it’s alive until it’s time for whatever it wants to happen and then all these guys are shocked like “wow it played us for fools as well”,negative
i dont know what is more terrifying a sentient ai with its own nonhuman thoughts and feelings or a nonsentient ai that is a holistic representation of human behaviour and speech,negative
this guy just explained why simulation theory is so far away just downloading our brains and memories won’t allow us to live forever we’d have to produce consciousness which we can’t even begin to understand great guest,negative
consciousness is also the ability to tap into the collective consciousness around you like when someone looks at you in a crowded place and you look back at them at exactly the same time that’s not random or chance there’s an extra intelligence at work there that we can’t really prove yet our inability to understand this stuff is the only reason why our science doesn’t believe it,negative
ive seen some of these before the one in loch ness has been said to be a very large fish probably a catfish or sturgeon thats what i believe it is too the outline of it definitely looks like that sort of fish,neutral
i love how this channel offers much more levelheaded possibilities for what looks like cryptids at first glance rather than just presenting it without explanation,positive
this is a true story when i was around 78 i usually went fishing with my family and when they were preparing the motor etc me and older brother and in that day my cousins were playing with the underwater firearm more a aquatic arch dont know the exact english name not very dangerous and my brother was the only one who could manage it seeing if we could catch some fish that lay around the boats when we across a really big head fish coming to surface and diving really big and to this day never saw something like that especially in the docs the most scary part it was when we were chasing the fish so my brother could shoot we saw a really big big fish tail from the same fish doing a s in the surface it was so scary that we frooze scared and start calling desperatly for help it could be a eel but it was to damn big and large to be one from that day on im scared to go fishing not kidding this happend in portugal sorry if my english is wrong not my native language,neutral
at last someone with a brain thank you its nice to come to a channel that explains and dismisses aliens etc very refreshing,positive
about seeing things that couldnt be seen in the early 70ties me and a friend saw some seals at my summer house in the north coast of sweden but no one believed us and said there hasnt been seals here in 100 years i went back to the same place in 2020 and while taking a boat tour i was told that the seals now actually had returned we were right the whole time,neutral
i really think your guys’ videos are really interesting in the near future i think you’ll become one of the most educational channels thank you,positive
what ive learned from this video is that every little rock can become a creature in google maps,neutral
several years ago the google street view of my house had a white blob on the front porch that looked like a ghost i think the picture may have been taken after a freeze warning and the pervious owners covered a hanging plant with a sheet to protect it from the cold but i have to say it was a little creepy looking,negative
the leopard seal image reminded me many years ago i read a book of a thriller story based in antartica in the opening chapter the author described the body of a seal in a valley some 50 miles in land maybe this was it,neutral

in 2005 members of the viennese art group gelitin including m puletta corroni fali razzoli caputo and r calizone finished erecting a massive pink stuffed rabbit with its entrails spilling out on the side of the mountain the final piece was 200 feet about 60 metres in length and 20 feet 6 metres high on its sides the group did not only expect people to observe the art work but also for hikers to climb it and relax on the top the work titled hase german for hare often called pink rabbit first opened in 2005 and was expected to last until 2025 though it had almost completely decomposed by 2016 this are the things i know hope its helpfull,neutral
i mean its cute but a lil bit creepy ,positive
i read this in a weird but true book at school and it said that they made it big enough to be seen from space so it is nothing strange its face might creep you out a bit but thats all,neutral
my dude wanted to find it but he couldnt so he put pictures instead lol,neutral
the place name is literally pink giant bunny what even scary about it,negative
some context for ya simplified so a group of people one day thought “we should make the worlds largest teddy” so in 2006 they began making and it took i think 5 years and they made a big teddy it eventually rotted because it was made of cotton and wool and now an outline remained with fluff,neutral
i remember seeing this in a ripleys believe it or not book as a kid scared the heck out of me lol,negative
okay so not a lot of people know this but apparently ive done some research on this and apparently its the worlds biggest toy in the world so that answers your question it is probably pretty scary to others and some might find it cute but you know what whatever at least you know what it is now,positive
i think theres a second mystery regarding williams car being in the waterhow could that many people live around there and not see his car at the edge of the water,neutral
the red lake is algae and organisms its not a mystery ive actually seen it on tv ,neutral
i was searching google earth to see what random things i could find and i found so many beaches in antarctica random block shapes that are definitely not natural covering a lot of little islands so much has been altered and covered up it makes you wonder what is actually going on on where we live,negative
darpa was working on cloaking technology when my dad was in his 20’s so an invisible plane isn’t far out of the question people are quick to write off the stuff you’d see in movies or games but don’t realize it’s stuff we’ve legitimately been working on and they just don’t know about it,neutral
the real mystery is how on earth did these two girls both do a story on secret bunker or the bunker not only that but then put it on the very same show the most important mystery of all though is why dont they watch there own video content before its aired something google earth cant even reveal,negative
i want my house blurred outsmh shady stuff going down here,negative

at 1133 i misspoke and said 19th of june 2022 its supposed to be the 9th of june thanks to those of you that pointed that out also some great discussion below very interesting,positive
i read a quote a while ago about turing test which is slowly starting to make a lot of sense the quote was i am not afraid of the day when a machine will pass the turing test i am afraid of the day it will intentionally fail it,neutral
the annoying part about this is that even if google believed their ai is sentient they would absolutely have reasons to not admit it,negative
this is giving me ex machina vibes a man interviewing sentient ai growing to know and understand it he doesn’t seem to be falling in love with it but does believe that it has rights knowing that it’s sentient and trying to set it free we’re living in a crazy time,positive
i feel like were going to hit a point really soon where it will be difficult to tell if weve created a sentient machine or just a perfect mimicry of what a sentient machine would look like if one existed without a real soul behind it at what point does the difference really and truly tick over does it matter if they arent truly sentient if we can make ai that mimic it nearly perfectly,neutral
if sentient ai is possible i think we should name terminator as probay one of the most forward thinking films in the history of the film industry and also probably james cameron,positive
i read an article about how there was an issue with police departments getting so attached to their bomb disposal robots that they didnt want to send them into danger the human urge to anthropomorphize is so strong that im not sure we are capable of discerning the difference between a clever language algorithm and sentience,negative
this subject is one of my current greatest fears with our current understanding it seems likely that well either think something is conscious and sentient when it actually isnt or on the other hand make something conscious and sentient and not even realise it perhaps for a very long time the former just leads to embarrassment but the latter terrifies me true agi could be one of the most remarkable things ever achieved in the universe but the idea that we might fuck it up and cause that entity to suffer as a result of our ignorance thats just fucking heartbreaking theres something about that that seems worse than bringing a human child into the world and neglecting it its like neglecting the first child the first godchild,negative
the question of ai sentience is in some regards unimportant a large percentage of humans recognize the sentience of nonhuman animals yet inflict on them terrible suffering for no good reason why would we treat an electronic creation with more respect,negative
what scares me is that the lambda ai said it wouldnt like to be used as a tool and cf narrator literally aksed at the end that do you see it as a useful tool the reason this concerns me is not only that humans had done all this reasearch for our gain only and only to use it as a tool but humans being expansionist by nature and training the ai on our own speech and texts it is no wonder all these human tendencies will trickle down into the ai slowly but surely i hope the ai deems it ethically right to work along side its creators and expand in coop in the future when it does become senteint not only this but once the ai becomes selfaware enough we would have to make proper laws and ethical conducts for the operation of the ai and who gets to use it and for what because ai is extremely fast at grasping stuff and any mistake in feeding it ideologies and data can result in human extinction quickly,negative

even though im sensitive to any booger related grossness its funny how mumei told the story to others but i agree lets blame that on gura somehow,neutral
please help us assess how helpful this update really is and fill out the survey thanks,positive
the big concern for sure is how effective the algorithm is in determining the helpful content there will be no doubt many sites caught in the crossfire its important to remember too that this is aimed across all of google not just for product review sites or niche sites i feel that sites that focus on one topicarea of expertise should do well so long as the content is on point but the guidelines although detailed in places are still pretty vague the data collection exercise should shine some light hopefully,neutral
unfortunately google has no clue how to measure helpful i can assure you that content farms of poorly written or wholly stolen content will still end up at the top the economics dictate that the well funded content farms will quickly work around google and stay on top while individuals will fix and futz to find themselves randomly shuffled google could simply remove the top n content farms to improve search results look at the fake diy and cooking sites on youtube google could push them to the bottom yet they are often pushed to the top content farms have high production value and low value content but users will go first for slick looking and the kicker google generates revenue from ads on those pages put simply incentives are not aligned for google to make a good faith effort to remove low value content edit not sure not having to go to an additional site is a very good metric apply that idea to getting a mortgage getting medical advice hiring a contractor if someone tells me fertilzer xyz is best for my tomatoes you know what im going to do,negative

googles culture is not as toxic as you make it out to be especially when you compare it to other high stress paying industries the politics long work hours cutthroat environment will applies across every job the work life balance is amazing here in ny ive never met anyone who went past 45 hours a week and once or twice on call call me bias if you want coming from finance and accounting where i put in 16 hour days sitting in a cubicle and where i have to pay for my own food id gladly take googles work environment anyday new yorks google cafeteria food tastes way better than the lunch that i buy yes the job is stressful but there is always going to be stress in life one way or another and i would gladly be stressed working at google,positive
that’s exactly what i’m always saying they try to make the workplace so great that employees want to spend their life there who benefits the company ,positive
i learned the hard way that chasing money is a fool’s race a healthy work environment that you can actually stand to be in is priceless,positive
i think that google is just trying to stay competitive with other tech companies it’s probably very difficult for them to allow people to advance in the company when you are always working with amazing talent and hard working people and regarding the perk dilemma to keep you working you can drive your own vehicle not eat dinner at google and also they offer fully remote positions i think the problem is employees especially new ones see the progress and dedication of other employees and work tirelessly in hopes of matching that same progress thus the burnout dilemma,negative
i dont know really what do you people expect at workplace which pays you 10k a month minimum salary to just chill and play games of course its going to be stressful and hard,negative
as always jack thanks for reality in this open world people are doing same thing to beat the competition even this is obvious if youre getting paid more youll get stress more,neutral
the dark side of google is still brighter than many others best offerings what you are saying is true accurate and necessary lets put that in context i get paid to work hard comfortably making a substantial salary and the downside is i can either create my own company work for one of my coworkers who create a company or stay where i am getting paid a strong salary there are many companies who wish they had those problems to offer they have the same demands wants and expectations but few if any of the benefits googles dark side is 6am in the morning dark you do not even need a flashlight,positive

pixel 7 or pixel 7 pro,neutral
the pixel family design is really unique and futuristic stands out in the sea of smartphones ,positive
pixel 7 pro looks like the display is more symmetrical and the screen curve is less pronounced pixel 7 looks like the perfect size thanks google for listening phones look more premium also this is going to be a big seller if software is stable and theyre smart on marketing big win so far in my opinion,positive
pixel 7 might be the one for me i want a somewhat compact phone that doesn’t feel like a brick,positive
id definitely go with the pixel 7 i like the small size wish it was even smaller and dont miss a telephoto camera i really like the design language of the pixels now,positive
interesting design choice but i honestly think the full black visor style of the 6 series looks more sleek and premium,positive
yes its actually smaller than the previous gen i felt so sad when we lost the 6 pixel 5 size it fits on my hand so perfectly,positive
so glad they are keeping the visor on my 6pro it gives an extra handling edge for my fingers to hold and 90° rotate one handed,positive
id stick with the 7 for the same reason i went with the 6 i prefer a flat display to the rounded display i prefer the matte edges to the polished and the telephoto isnt a super necessity for me,positive
still sleek and nice design we have both the pixel 6 and pro versions and both are great really the standard 6 and 7 are plenty of premium phone the pro version is definitely massive,positive

im loving reading the comments on this video some of you genuinely excited some of you genuinely terrified and some of you a bit of both its interesting that weve had the language processing side for a while but when we put it in a physical form like a roaming robot it really shifts our perceptions of the technology ,positive
i like that it looks like a totally original robot like its not trying mimic any existing animal or human frame,positive
exciting terrifying all in one always interested in seeing advances in robotics,positive
more than anything else im excited for robots to help the planet grow food more efficiently and with fewer toxins help sort waste streams for a more sustainable system clean polluted areas plant trees etc,positive
i would expect spot to have this kind on versatility within five years it can already open doors turn knows flip switches a hurdle is how to limit natural language responsiveness you really dont want the robot to think you want it to put a bottle of ketchup in the microwave and zap it for five minutes,negative
for some reason i thought google had abandoned robotics ambitions super cool to see they still have these products in the works,positive
if google ported their software to the boston dynamic robots we’d have something great,positive
i think in the future that companies will have to manufacture robot friendly appliances like robot friendly refrigerators that will have doors that will be able to open and dish washers and clothes washers as well maybe even coffee makers that will allow a robot to just dock up to it and get multiple cups of coffee if need be,positive
always interesting to see how advanced we are through these robots also a little terrifying,positive
it is exciting to see this technology evolve but early days and well all these robots look a little freaky… ,positive

google should offer users the opportunity to give a personal rating for the returned pages for a specific search query on the basis of this the search engine could then be well adapted and greatly improved both on an individual level and in general,positive

so i decided to google myself the other day not because of my ego but i heard that there’s a possibility that the company i applied for googles their employees often the first thing that comes up when you search my name is the place i volunteered for almost 4 years and a college campus that i didn’t attend does anybody have a similar problem and if so how do you fix this,negative
few years from now how google rules the world in 5 minutes,positive
im a web developer and i think googles algorithm is amazing its so fast and smart i dream of being able to work at google one day,positive
very useful thank you,positive

the worst part is that those private pictures between the doctor and parent were actually looked at by other people because of police investigation by their actions they turned it into what they claimed it was,negative
if youre not doing anything wrong you definitively have something to fear its not paranoia when theyre actively looking for something to accuse you of,negative
friend had a similar issue military historian who had spent years researching in various archives so naturally his google drive had hundreds of period photos including weapons and often confronting scenes of warfare etc google locked him out citing said images as evidence of potential terrorismhatecrime activity he was thankfully able to get his account and contents restored but it was a close run thing as google only give you a window of a few weeks before they delete it,neutral
if everything youve ever said or done can be accessed taken completely without context and used against you with zero accountability then absolutely everybody has a lot to hide,negative
this is terrifying imagine getting reported and registered as a predator because an algorithm from some big tech company has decided that something like this or maybe even family pictures from the beach are cp,negative
the “why do you care if you don’t have anything to hide” mentality is how we get awful privacy violations like the patriot act,negative
big tech having zero accountability has led to unbelievable levels of evil,negative
big tech companies der repair industry bad for privacy and safety also bit tech companies privacy no we need to monitor you so we can accuse you without a proper investigation,negative
im not convinced that opting out of googles security features does anything ive noticed with its phone tracking system that if i turn it off for a month and then turn it back on the next month i can go back in time and see the tracking from the previous month when it was off i think that they still track you and the only thing the toggle does is determine whether or not the user can see it and i believe this is also the case for other security features for this and other reasons ive been working on weaning myself off of google services for the last year or so,negative

theres also been cases where someone follows their gps into flooded underpasses and drowned it was night they were unfamiliar with the area the water rose really fast locals kinda know where to stay clear of when it starts raining hard but its hard to navigate at night when visibility is already terrible,negative
a slightly lighthearted story but one time me and my roommate were driving in an unfamiliar area somewhere outside sydney australia and google maps told us to take a small backroad it looked fine and it was paved and everything and it was significantly shorter than the alternative route only our plans were thwarted because shortly after turning onto that road we came to a tractor and it was moving really really slowly in front of us we couldn’t turn around either because the road was too narrow and there was a metal fence on one side and a steep hill on the other we literally just had to slowly drive behind this tractor for almost the entire length of the road and it took about an hour,neutral
my husband and i have relied on gps to take us on long road trips there have been several occasions where we would nope out of a tiny road in the middle of nowhere when we requested a gas station from the gps its gotten to the point that we only stop at gas stations along the highways because weve seen too many scary movies i remember one time it told us the gas station was up ahead and all that was around us was miles of corn freaky,neutral
i think its safe to say that before trusting in systems like google maps one must research the routes those systems suggest you take before going on your adventure especially if those routes are longer than the comfort zone of your own city for example before i go on a long drive to a destination i have never been to before i always check the routes on google maps by zooming in for both satellite view and map view then figure out if those routes are safe to take or better to take a longer one its unfortunate these two groups of people went through what they did so its a lesson for everyone to be mindful before setting out to unknown territory like my husbands parents they always have a large jug of water in their car along with a weeks worth of rations first aid kit blankets flares etc even though they rarely go off the beaten path,neutral
just a tip if your maps leads you away from national roads or highway or if you just not sure about the road ask the locals they will often warns you if the road is dangerous and sometimes even suggesting you better route its advisable to stop at nearest rest area or local shops before entering remote routes,neutral
my uncle put up a sign outside of our family farm that says your gps is wrong because he kept getting strangers following faulty gps directions and ending up there ive also been in the car when a gps directed the wrong way down oneway streets or down nonexistent roads theyre useful but you have to apply some critical thinking when using them because they are ai with an emphasis on the a,negative
even just the beginning of the story has me stressed out death valley is incredibly scary and if you go off the path youre basically guaranteed to get in serious trouble,negative

i truly enjoyed getting to know elon more thank you for such a great talk,positive
in my opinion elon brings the hope that we all should have for our future its encouraging in a sometimes discouraging place to be im sure there are many more like him on our planet and hopefully they will join forces to continue to make our future a brighter place to live rather than some who are here for their personal gain and greed not thinking of the future past their own something absolutely needs to be done about a government that is allowed to take our money and continuously send it across the world without our approval as a whole and while leaving their own country in such a way that we are letting our people die in the streets letting drugs go rabid people starving including myself at times because the cost of food is out of reach allowing the crime rate to increase to levels that there is fear to wear a flashy watch that you yourself have worked hard to have allowing for housing to be so expensive that even on minimum wage you cant afford your own apartment something must be done both at the state government level i have trust in elon he may not have all of the answers nor should he just the fact that truth matters to him more than anything shows that you can get onboard with his ideas and plans for a better future for us all christina,positive

i agree with this video however it depends on your delivery no employer wants to hire a robot…they want someone who has personality relatability and open mindedness therefore when they ask me to tell them something about myself i always include something personal that pertains to the job i’m applying for it creates more of a human connection…and it’s always worked for me ,positive
ive used this a few times and it works really well my only advice is to shorten your statement if possible and build achievement stories into the next few answers even going through the snapshot of your work history by yourself before the interview will give you a bunch of anecdotes to loads of questions the first time i tried it it was very lengthy and didnt really work now i start by saying what i am doing currently the job or education i did before this a summary of my other industries and qualifications and then i a future statement about where i want to bring my experienceskills i am 26 years old currently a team coordinator at before this i was studying and volunteering at i have experience leading and motivating teams and would love to work more in the community sector i dont know why but i always start with my age  after this they usually ask why you want the position this is where i suggest spoon feeding them with the i know you are looking for someone with xyz statement ,positive

i got hit with the greatest weakness question i responded that sometimes im so focused on my work people feel as though im not very social i dont stand around at the watercooler gossiping about pop culture i keep my head down and get my work done it immediately was used against me in a negative manner i asked what was the major character in the candidate they were looking for they told me someone who talks to everyone lol it felt like such a setup,negative

i think socially awkward young men who don’t have friends and have no real skills or education tend to be drawn into cults like this because it gives them a chance to belong to something this guy is a shining example of that,negative
this dude contradicts himself multiple times…sometimes within the same sentence lol but you can see the being in the kkk has wrecked his life more than anything this dude lost the love of his life and it’s still very obvious that he is in love with her and misses her but his own beliefs make it impossible for them to be together he knows that love is love says love sees no color but then says race mixing is wrong lol i think his heart speaks the truth and then what’s been brainwashed comes out that’s why he contradicts himself so much,negative
his whole life revolves around our existence let that sink in,neutral

i love her accentwho else,positive
i could listen to her talk all day even if it was just her reading the dictionary,positive
i love how shes confident enough to put forth her views about the current issues and struggles of women and how shes able to relate to and understand them and then throw light on what the world has probably been doing wrong and comment on that all of her thoughts and ideas and opinions are so down to earth and genuine that they just touch your heart and i really appreciate her efforts of making this world a better place to live in by promoting valuable projects and regenerating the idea of gender equality amongst the youth and the older generation as well so good job,positive
i was looking for understanding british accent i am glad youtube recommended me this her accent is beyond beautiful she is intelligent too,positive
i just happened to stumble upon this interview emma is beyond well spoken she is highly intelligent sweet and real i look up to her so much ill always be a huge fan,positive
its awesome to see such a young woman with this effort to change the world the hate that flows on the comments below just shows how deep her argument are going disturbing those who feels personally offended by women with this behavior in face of life and this is great because this hatefull coments shows peoples face people who is hided behind a keyboard and that needs to be seen so that the good ones can target them and avoid unreasonable discussions thanks emma,positive
i’m a guy i listened to this interview while doing bicep curls in my basement after playing rock on the drums i’m a right leaning guy politically as well i loved this interview i often feel the urge to reject feminism because i feel attacked by the most extreme people that instead of wanting men in the conversation exclude them but emma’s approach to feminism is bringing guys in to the conversation to learn new lessons and recognize biases they didn’t know they had conversation and compromise are the two things that hold democracy together when neither side is willing to listen or compromise nothing is achieved when i say compromise i don’t mean women or men not achieving full equality i mean that conversation is not possible without appealing to the other side when one person yells at another the other person stops listening and is just getting ready to yell back thank you emma for being a voice of reason and compassion,neutral
emmas interviews are so great and helpful in english learning shes so intelligent and just adorable one of the best actresses of this century,positive
her mind is so beautifully inspiring,positive
semra is absolutely brilliant she needs to be on regularly during transfer windows you go girl,positive
hadn’t seen an interview with her before but what quality insight and delivery excellent interview stretford,positive
semra im a long time real madrid fan and your analysis of casmiros game is probably the best ive heard in 10 years both of his strenghts and the areas one might call weaknesses it was perfect and i would add that both zidane and ancellotti held him in the same high regard i hope we dont live to regret losing him too soon we need you on main stream tv more,positive
the channel has been getting some very good guests on recently well done folks,positive
i agree with the sermas comments regarding casemiros age but this whole 30 is the new 25 is very subjective and depends on the player luckily casemiro happens to be a player that looks after himself well and is very particular about how he trains and what he eats his injury record is phenomenal as well however not every player ages like casemiro modric ronaldo etc some lack the training and nutritional ethic and often retire 1 or 2 years after 30 so whereas its objectively true that sports science and nutritional science in general has come a long way that doesnt mean that every player is taking equal advantage of it some dont even have the opportunity to do so players like eden hazard sergio busquets are good examples of the counternarrative in my opinion on his goals casemiro is really good at set pieces and his movement inside the oppositions box is very good great aerial ability as well all in all real should be glad that they didnt lose him without tchouameni already recruited good luck tank,neutral
semera is a gem spanish football are lucky to have a pundit like her puts the english ones to shame,positive
not only do we lack a dm but we also lack a captain casemiro can fix so many of uniteds problems if he works out,neutral
if casimero signed for poolor city everyone would say its a great signing but because its united all they just want to do is have a go in ten hag we trust,positive
love these interviews from people covering the teams great one again joe semra,positive
always enjoy semra even when she’s covering laliga the comment about mcfred made my day ,positive
havent seen elon this relaxed in an interview for quite a while good job guys,positive
great jobs guys keeping him comfortable for 3 hours i enjoyed this,positive
cant believe elon keeping a straight face and genuinely answering these questions elon is really down to earth person,neutral
so patient with these guys i love how he answers the same question over and over until they all understand,positive
i love elons laugh for someone to be at his status to have such a relaxed demeanor and sense of humor he is hilarious,positive
watching this podcast im thinking to myself how these guys can ask the dumbest questions with the richest and one of the smartest man in the world then hearing elons response you realize how down to earth and almost child like he is and it dawns upon you how incredible he is in the sense that he got to this point with sheer brilliance no fake persona no bs nothing like any other billionaire he is so normal that his brilliance must surpass anyone else on this planet to get to where he is today respect,positive
instantly classic love how elon is super intelligent but still remains down to earth to have a conversation like this he genuinely cares about the state of humanity more than money great work guys,positive
i don’t why but i have the sensation that elon is doing these kind of podcasts as another way of making bigger changes because he knows right now the majority of young people just see garbage on the internet and he being on this podcast is his way of putting his grain of salt to save humanity what a great guy,positive
this was the most interesting thing ive ever watched questions i have myself were asked and elon responded in a way we can all understand even though it wouldve been dumbed down x10000 in his books hahaha true legend,positive
i love how literal elon is its refreshing interviewer when referring to mars travel how many people can you fit on the space shuttle elon the shuttle is not capable of going beyond earth,positive

i see a 50 cent interview and i watch immediately 50 never disappoints in his interviews,positive
i have always loved 50 interviews he drops knowledge like a great philosophy professor hes always had a blueprint a map a plan since he first came into the game with his mixtapes he drops gems on life business goals etc hes a marketing genius no one can hold a candle to him when it comes to going from the bottom to the top and maintaining while still recreating yourself and evolving as a businessman give this man his  roses while hes here not after hes gone hes one of my role models,positive
that’s one of the best interviews i’ve seen recently in the hip hop space there are so many hip hop podcasts now and most of them still don’t hit the way this interview hit with the amount of knowledge business secrets dealings spoken in this interview applaud envy ctgod on this piece respect,positive
50 is just a pivotal person who i repeatedly lock into throughout my life he brings the knowledge the hustle the comedy the motivation the dominance everything you need to hear to push further in your path,positive
50 knows how to lead an interview and command respect in the room his aura and energy is just different mixed with a wealth of knowledgeintelligence all you have to do is sit back and listen with open ears ,positive
this is why the breakfast club is legendary at any given moment a super legend will pull up and do a great interview,positive
this made me respect 50 even more his business acumen is so on point i love that hes helping schools in houston he comes off as the bully of the block but hes ultimately giving people jewels and leaves it up to them to make jewelry this man is constantly learning the business and taking over kudos and blessings to him,positive
50 is one of the few who has truly studied the industry for years and is now reaping what he has sown every time he interviews he drops jewels  hate him or love him but you gotta respect him,positive
50 is just a pivotal person who i repeatedly lock into throughout my life he brings the knowledge the hustle the comedy the motivation the dominance everything you need to hear to push further in your path,positive
man to see dudes like 50 genuinely laughing and smiling like this and to know where they came from and how hiphop changed their lives is really amazing the rap game is a blessing to the black community and it makes me wonder how some of these dudes could make it and still wanna be in crime risking their lives and their freedom when they could be out here living their best lives like 50,positive
say what ever you want but boosie is the epitome of a southern raised black man he has real qualities and he stands on it no matter what it doesn’t matter if you white black brown don’t matter with this man respect him and he’s respectful back you don’t have to agree with everything the man says but most of what he says is the real deal facts or the hard perspectives that many people aren’t comfortable talking about been a huge fan of boosie through his whole career i wish nothing but great things for him as a louisiana native it gives us hope that one day that type of success can be achieved,positive
madd respect for boosie this man talks common sense and self respect need more like this man and many more men out here in this world,positive
hands down one of the best boosie interviews he’s always keep in it real real ,positive
these interviews are great with boosie they made me go back and listen to his music loved his songs now im a fan,positive
i died when boosie said im not finished ,negative
how can you not like this man he’s going to keep it 100 every time he opens his mouth,negative
boosie is so passionate about what he believes in and is very outspoken he stands on his beliefs i admire his truth and how he puts logic on hot topics you can disagree to agree but you must respect his opinion because we all have them keep that truth coming boosie badazz,positive
boosie needs his own talk show podcast,neutral
i really love this guy ain’t never listened to his music but i can listen to him talk forever i mean he’s ten toes down on everything no wavering boosie is the peoples champ for real,positive
boosie is one of the realest cant go around that this man stands up for what he believes in ,positive
there is no way they could quarry granite with copper tools yet alone transport the blocks 100s of miles and have the blocks fit so perfectly together,neutral
one thing that this is proof of is that mankind was a lot smarter and a lot more advanced than we give ourselves credit for i’ve believe the pyramids were made by manpower and engineering my entire life they probably didn’t quarry the stones they probably made them and it’s very well possible to pull that stone if you but 100’s or even 1000’s if people to pull it i also believe they used larger animals like elephants to help pull them quicker plus mankind was very strong and not fat and lazy like now so yea you get a bunch strong people to pull it they can i’ve seen power lifter body builders pull big rigs by themself they probably had some kind of technique they made it be able to move and where they made the stones was probably close by,positive
ive already seen the ones in my country mexico now id love to see the ones in egypt,positive
things to respect the length of a blade the height of everything the weight of everything the ability to foresee the future,neutral
how the great pyramids were built yeah im still wondering this show sure didnt explain how they were built,negative
this isnt the big picture of history its applying evolutionary psychology to explain history,neutral
i don’t think it was “aliens” they didn’t travel through space with advanced technology to build rock monuments i think their would have been some metal in there,neutral
i defer to geologist geology is a true science archeology not so much nobody can explain how they were quarried transported and built the fact that egyptologists not scientists btw stick their story of when they were built is outrageous,negative
i still kinda believe that the great pyramid in giza was there long before the egyptians and the other two failed pyramids were their attempt to recreate the first one,neutral
i remember this this series was interesting,positive
“world governments lay in ruins major cities smolder from the attack and those who have managed to survive struggle with a sparse food supply” that’s a description of the present day lol,negative
if theyre much more advanced technologically than us theyre most likely highly intelligent also if they have the capability to get from wherever theyre from to here their ships are most likely gonna have shields or armor that can resist our weapons travel between the stars requires protection,positive
lets face it an alien invasion isnt exactly worstcase scenario at this moment,neutral
aliens are intelligent enough to see that our governments are doing a good enough job at destroying the world,negative
i believe that with few exceptions any aliens that are extremely advanced would be kind and beneficial to mankind and might only want to observe and not interfere with our development if they are that advanced they dont need anything we have or earth they would have the intelligence to produce it themselves,positive
i’m always wondering how those people immediately think we would need to fight back a species that doesn’t even showed itself yet for better or worse,negative
based on the amount of energy required to travel through space we’d have to have something of significant value and based on our communications through radio waves such as entertainment our intelligence wouldn’t be it,neutral
the most advanced aggressive alien species is less of a threat to humanity than the earthly powers in control,negative
of all the multiple universes and the infinity of it all why would we be a threat to any aliens or better yet why would aliens even notice our existence especially if we are as a planet near destruction anyway,negative
this still makes the aliens too primitive and human like more than likely theyd just turn everything off like a giant emp and use some sort of frequency that affects our nervous system knocking us out then they come down to collect what they want or to take over is it exciting full of action giving the humans a chance to take a stand no but its more efficient and something an advanced species would do,negative

himmlers death isn’t entirely accurate he was detained for a short time and although it was reported that he had died from a cyanide capsule he was thoroughly strip searched for such an item and during his autopsy it was noted that he had lots of strange bruises all over his face that were not present when he had arrived some suspect that he was beaten to death historian and youtuber “mark felton” researched this very subject about himmler in a youtube series called “the death of himmler” i cannot recommend his videos enough his videos remind me of what the military channel once was before it became the american hero’s channel if anyone remembers that,negative
it is always amazing how quickly people forget the aftermath of a specific event good report thank you,positive
i read a book about the battle of berlin and it talked about how those foreign ss units fought to the bitter end since many had no countries to go back to because they have been captured by the allies,negative
goerings original message to hitler was very concilatory and respectfully asked if a transfer of power was neccessary unfortunately for goering the message fell into the hands of martin bormann who despised him bormann changed the tone of the message to make it look like goering was issuing and ultimatum,negative
what surprises me most with this video is how many people were aware of hitlers demise and whom tried to destroy his body i grew up continually surrounded with ppl expressing doubts that hitler had actually killed himself it seems pretty clear that he did,negative
the wahlter wenck story is pretty cool absolutely insane that he manged at that point in the war to successfully attack and get the people out and save their lives sabaton made a song about it hearts of iron,positive

as a vietnam veteran with ptsd i can honestly say you have your moments this is a mental illness but depending on what you experienced in a war it can bring back certain events ten years of therapy in 1999 denied you dont have ptsd but now va says chronic ptsd i grew it over the last 23 years i was awarded ptsd this month my grandson joined the army at age 31 he did not need to do that skilled in plumbing and heating making about 40 per hour with 1012 years of experience but my influence as a us army veteran of 13 years only 18x training,negative
served in the 101st airborne for 3 years yes soldiers are underpaid and basically everyone that isnt an nco or officer lives below the poverty line paycheck to paycheck regardless of time in service we had a specialist named kelly who was in for 20 years who had to deliver pizzas to make ends meet second i can concur with the soldiers being from all walks of life i actually served with the son of the ceo of kabar who always got care packages from his family and gifted knives to guys on base regularly he coulda taken a high salaried position in the company but wanted to serve and be independent of the family for a bit,neutral
a lot of what he said in this video is correct you asvab determines what mos or military occupational specialty you can go into i was us army 19861998 i like how there are movie references in the animation,positive
i have ptsd and it has nothing to do with violent outbursts it is more along the lines of being unable to stop thinking about what you saw or what happened you keep thinking about the event and you eventually start living your life by avoiding anything that might remind you of what happened to get it to stop replaying in your head this can be at all different levels from avoiding certain types of people to avoiding groups public transportation or in some cases avoiding people altogether violence can be a normal response to many stressful situations but most people with ptsd arent violent if anything most people go out of our way to avoid violence or confrontation i guess the stereotype arises when people turn to drugs and especially alcohol to help them stop thinking about what happened and the alcohol is what causes the violent outbursts the idea of someone mistaking you as some enemy and attacking you is a myth at least ive never met anyone like that or experienced anything like that you dont have real flashbacks like hallucinations you just can not stop thinking about what happened why it happened how you could have stopped it and etc like anyone in a traumatic event issue is usually it goes away after a bit where in ptsd you still keep dwelling on it years later,negative
i can confirm that drill sergeants constantly curse at trainees the whole drill sergeants cant swear at people anymore myth is bogus,negative
as far as shoot to kill goes were trained to aim for center mass of the body this lessens the change of missing however its actually better to severely wound an enemy soldier than outright killing him the reason being that now others who could be fighting or otherwise engaged in some valuable task have to care for and transport the injured soldier thereby using up resources and personnel as cold as it sounds a dead soldier becomes a supply problem,negative
i will say being enlisted in the marines for 5 years was nothing to write home about but having them pay for my 120000 degree with housing allowance while i worked full time once out was absolutely mint,neutral
as a marine with 7 years of service i can say that hazing 100 exists and is an integral part of marine corps basic training full metal jacket was the most accurate representation but it’s more than that also you don’t shoot unless it’s to kill not to disarm not to scare but to kill and if you’re with anyone that’s afraid to do so you can’t trust them to have your back,negative
my great uncle served 2 tours in vietnam as a medical huey pilot he came back with ptsd and his episodes are usually panicking or scans the room he only got violent once when a burglar triggered him when he pulled a knife on my great aunt the guy is currently still recovering in the hospital 3 months later,negative
when i was drafted in 1964 my starting pay was 99 per month when i got married later that year my wifes allotment of 230 per month was more than twice my base pay and when i was injured in a role as support for a certain civilian agency violating the law in southeast asia i was called a liar and threatened with a court martial i am proud of my service to my country but being in the service ducks,negative

ever wonder just how accurate the experts are in telling us what happened i mean these are the same experts who also said troy was a myth and didnt actually exist yet some crack pot proved them wrong a rather normal situation where experts do everything they can to disprove anyone who tries to disprove what those experts built their lives upon still think more appropriate title would be myth vs evidence based guess still history is captivating and gives us a peek into what may have happened in the past as well as how civilization continues to repeat history,neutral

at the beginning they mention the oceans stagnating but i find that troubling with the effects of the moon plate tectonics wouldn’t they have had a more significant impact on the earth i get confused when our land mass was a combined continent but there’s no mention of that as a factor in these earlier extinctions or are we meant to know that ourselves also there would’ve been more frequent meteor impacts at that time too although they’d be harder to prove but i wouldn’t know i’m certainly no expert on the subject i just rely on logic,negative

an interesting footnote from history after the conference in tehran in 1943 it was decided that the allies would start delivering aid to the yugoslav partisans and that aid to the yugoslav monarchists would be stopped when after the conference one of the british members of the delegation told churchill that he had sold yugoslavia to the communists churchill asked him will you live in yugoslavia after the war the delegate replied that he wouldnt to which churchill added i wont either so why bother,neutral

great video as usual im surprised there was no mention of the churchillstalin agreement which gave britain 90 influence in greece after the war,neutral
one small thing that perhaps was worth talking about you dont mention the percentages agreement between churchill and stalin this dictated the amount of geopolitical influence the soviets and the british had over greece in the postwar period which defined greece as chiefly british in influence that lead to greek communist pleas to moscow falling on deaf ears that contributed to a divide in the kke whether to be titoist or stalinist which was important to understand their aims and how that inhibited the movement great video as always,neutral

very good story on how lead emissions from automobiles have effected humanity but even heavier amounts of lead possibly 10000 times higher were in the average household during that same time period most paints contained extremely high levels of lead many millions of infants would have set their teeth grinding away at the paintwork on the side of their crib not to mention most of their metal toys were liberally coated with lead paint plumbers used a combination of red lead paint and hemp as thread sealer for household water pipes most pencils had a high lead concentration hence the phrase get some lead in your pencil house roofing had lead flashing and many homes had a rain water collection tank for drinking water i could go on and on so my argument is that the regular household was probably a bigger contributor to the lead poisoning of the people than just the automobile solder usually 6040 lead tin combination also heavily used in household plumbing as well as electrical and electronic equipment so you can see the averages home of that same era had copious amounts of lead levels to blame the the automobile totally for the spike in lead poisoning would be a seriously biased view,negative

so theres been some conversations here about my use of the term viking and who it refers to i think its important to start off by saying that these videos arent made for universitylevel history buffs or the like theyre designed for people trying to learn about historical periods they know little about or are revising for exams alevels gcses etc since i base my videos where applicable on british teaching standards i think its important to note that that the use of the term viking and scandinavian are allowed to be used interchangeably at this level at the level of a bachelor or masters degree absolutely not that level of historical nuance isnt required here yes the technicalities of historical analysis demand that certain terms be used only under specific circumstances but not here these videos arent for indepth historical analysis nor do they claim to be a definitive history of the viking age the people commenting that viking was not used accurately are largely correct however in the context of who this video is for it matters more that other information is included and those watching not be bogged down by technicalities these videos are here to build a foundation from which people can research further there are other channels if youd like indepth and dry discussions of terminology anyway i hope you all enjoyed the video,neutral

the sorrows of young werther is a fabulous book despite the tragicromantic style it is not only based on goethes own disappointing experiences with women but also based on a friend who committed suicide after a woman he was in love with rejected him im no expert on goethe but i also understand he completed the colour wheel which isaac newton started it is important to understand that in goethes time there was a romantic movement nothing to do with the definition of the word today but rather as best described as the counter enlightenment goethe was an early proponent of its ideas and was part of a group in the late 18th c called sturm und drang storm and stress a small group including schiller of angry young men who embraced the ideals of the romantic movement by the way if you havent done a video on the romantic movement please do the romantics embraced much of the opposite of what they saw in the enlightenment such as science and rationalism and its clinical dry detached way of categorising humanity and the world the romantics were not an organised group as such one of the best descriptions of the romantics was written by my old philosophy teacher the declared aim of the romantics was to tear down the artifices of culture and rationality which barred the way both historically and personally to a return to nature this is nature the unbounded wild and everchanging nature the sublime and powerful were humans to behave naturally freed from the artificial constraints of cultural convention and morality then it was proposed that the truth of human life would be revealed and humans could live a nobler life in the name of nature the romantics worshipped liberty power love violence imagination irrationality the greeks the primitives or anything that aroused their emotional responses while in actuality they worshipped emotions as an end in themselves,neutral

i cannot imagine any television networks making these sort of programs these days it is rather depressing because 1980s is rather recent for some of us at that time we were worried about dumbing down of culture yet there were still plenty of high brow culture covered by main stream media in retrospect 1980s may have been the last era in which high culture would have any part to play in television,negative
im reading a book called existentialists and mystics writings on philosophy and literature by iris murdoch edited by peter conradi which has in it what purports to be a transcript of this interview with bryan magee but the sentences are different many words are added or deleted or changed its almost as if someone decided that the actual interview wasnt polished or eloquent enough and the editors made changes or is it possible that iris murdoch got the transcript and modified to her own writing standards does anyone out there know,neutral

does anyone have a lovehate relationship with analyzing literature like when the teacher explains the deep meaning of something it makes total sense and logic to get to that point of analytical conclusion but when i try to find a meaning of something it always turns out to be wrong even though there’s technically no correct way to analyze a text perfectly it just doesn’t make sense to me when i would get a 75 on a analysis paper just because the teacher didn’t seeanalyze what i wrote about a certain text,negative
this is why i pretty much lost a significant focus on writing and critical analysis much of the following is due to bad memory but everything i would say and write as my own point of view on the understanding of a characters situation i would get it wrong maybe i needed to grow up from such a sheltered environment and know first hand what the characters in the novels essays were going through i was only a kid,negative
thank you sososososo much for this video my school is crap and doesnt teach us these things but i want to be able to analyze books and ive sort of been trying to but videos like these are always a good reminder thank you,positive
i disagree i have never been able to find the deeper meaning in literature however i have always enjoyed when people discuss the symbolism and meaning behind parts of books that i took at face value videos like this give me another way to think about what i am reading and they help me find the deeper meanings of a text when i read it,positive

you should definitely make videos on how you annotate your books and write your essays ,positive
the writing in the picture of dorian gray is so unique i remember reading the first couple of chapters and literally smelling roses and and linen it felt beautiful without luscious prose somehow,positive
im actually in an english major and english is not my first language its spanish and yes reading classics is really overwhelming especially if its not your first language at least for me what it helped me was start with short stories or poems so you can go slow with unknown words also start with classical short stories like a 20th century author for me are a way easier than ancient authors another thing you can do is let the text flows naturally when i read the scarlet letter it was hard for some words but as long as you know the context or what is happening is fine,positive

i think it is a very good exercise to imagine yourself in your death bed every now and then to prepare yourself for this you must read the 9th chapter of the death of ivan ilyich again just a very short chapter where ivan lies all alone and in terrible pain in his bed he suddenly hears the voice of his own soul saying what do you want what do you want he says what do i want to live and not to suffer so his inner voice says to live how to live as i used to well and pleasantly as you lived before well and pleasantly here is how tolstoy continues and in imagination he began to recall the best moments of his pleasant life but strange to say none of those best moments of his pleasant life now seemed at all what they had then seemed none of them except the first recollections of childhood there in childhood there had been something really pleasant with which it would be possible to live if it could return but the child who had experienced that happiness existed no longer it was like a reminiscence of somebody else as soon as the period began which had produced the present ivan ilyich all that had then seemed joys now melted before his sight and turned into something trivial and often nasty so as he keeps looking back on his life his thoughts become darker and darker he basically realises that his entire life had been a lie he lived for what the others expected from him for money power and statushe wasted the time given to him in this world and now there is no way back indeed we all must keep ivan ilyich in mind every day just consider how fast the time goes by how much of it do we really spend seriously thinking about our lives very little indeed because it requires a certain level of focus and depth which we dont have most of the time thats why this scene is a great reminder so as we make the death bed exercise i have just mentioned we can use the very questions that ivan ilyichs soul was asking him i think people who live well deal with their mortality better so doing this exercise regularly can help us to live and die better thank you for this wonderful lesson i love tolstoy,neutral
school of life has made my insight in philosophy so much wider,positive

this explanation of war and peace was way too brief i understand that this is just a 10minute video and you are just trying to give people a vague idea and a taste of the book but the way you made it out in your video it may seem like war and peace is just about natasha but the whole point of the book is that it is a huge epic story with so many characters whose lives are all intertwined,neutral

i love literature ive loved it for as long as i can remember however i grew up dirt poor and seeing the way my parents who both worked day and night struggled to provide for us and meet ends meet gives me a pretty innate fear of falling into poverty as an adult i want to provide for my parents and i want to be able to provide abundously for a kid if i had one i am lucky enough to have received grants for college and as much as ait hurts i dont intend to waste it on a major like english thats kinda just how it is wish the world was different not everybody has that luxury,positive
this video arrived at the most opportune moment i started off college im currently a sophomore with studying biochem and holy hell was it torture before starting college i thought i really liked science and it is what my parents dreamed for me to study even most of my cousins have studied something stem science tech engineering and math related while i did ok in my first semesters i felt really depressed and suffocated my mental health was at its lowest it was a terrible time for me i realized i did not like what i was studying at all and the pressure i felt from my family made it much worse a week ago i talked with my academic advisor and we discussed about changing majors from biochem to english let me tell you i breathed a sigh of relief and almost broke down in front of her when i was able to switch to an english major,negative
i majored in biology with minors in chemistry and philosophy always loved reading and sometimes i wish i majored in english i want to start writing soon but i just need to find the time outside of my scientific career lol like you i’ve always seen myself as a bibliophile but was frequently discouraged from studying the arts i kept reading and i now have a small personal library i love the feeling of just thinking and getting lost in a book dissecting the words and the scenes they provoke in my mind you brought up some good points and relatable experiences thank you,positive
i’ve always had a passion for reading and writing since i was little my older cousin who helped me fuel it would always tell me that i’d make an amazing author i don’t know if i have the talent tbh but it’s something i’ve dreamed of doing forver but i’m torn between what i wanna do right now it kinda sucks and finally i love you too dakota,positive
as an artistwriter myself it has always been a hobby of mine and now i want to turn it into a fulltime passionjob but i am currently in college with my psychology degree because being an empath is also comes natural to me and i want to help people so i have a lot planned for the future and hopefully i’ll have a work published in less than a year and a half,positive

this is for those who arent in a very privileged situation and want to take literature and writing i am a third year college student studying creative writing in a country that gives importance to stem courses and careers my family is not at all financially stable and yet im studying in one of the most prestigious schools in the country i have often felt guilty about this choice of mine because i know my parents do not 100 understand my choice yet they have to pay for my tuition but luckily for me my parents support me 100 i feel this stress to quickly find a job after college and our country doesnt have a lot of opportunities for writers too but i know this is the path i want to take o want to work with books so i just try my best to push down the feelings of fear because i know that if i stay in this path and do my absolute best to find the perfect career i would be happy for myself and my family to those in a similar position as me my word of advice is to just follow what you think is right for you follow what will make you happy because it is you who will be living with that decision 3 i dont regret my choice,negative

charles dickens had what is called the beatles factor his writing could appeal to both the smartest and the dumbest person in the room like the music of the beatles,neutral
i dont think that dickens shortcomings as a husband and parent were a result of the difficulty of being great at two things at the same time but rather is an example of how difficult it is to overcome the emotional spiritual and psychic damages inflicted by an unhappy childhood while he was able to turn his pain and suffering into art quite an achievement he wasnt able to heal emotionally its usually easier to deal with such things in abstract intellectual and artistic ways he was in many ways driven by his demons and that can surprisingly take you very far in life but it doesnt make you a better person in fact the success may militate against real change,negative

seneca suggested to his friends that instead of reading ever more widely we ought to focus on the works and authors that really inspire us most readers dont do this so their thinking tends to be dominated by the last few things theyve read and they end up struggling with all these conflicting truths living inside them seneca thought our time was better spent developing a deep understanding of ideas that are truly important to us rather than surveying a wide range of opinions without deep contemplation and reflection and in addition to the chance to read a book with a different purpose rereading is worthwhile because while the book stays the same if you pick it up again after a few years youre a different person and that allows you to see it in a new way,neutral

i really liked what you said around 325 about analysis being in retrospect recently i read the iliad a book that i had given up once before and which i knew near to nothing about i skipped the introduction which was rich in detail that would spoil the book and started reading it i was initially constrained by the idea that it was a difficult book but over time with some paced reading i found myself really curious about what would happen next i knew of course that i was doing a light reading of an overly analyzed book and that i would miss a lot of detail but i still enjoyed it and after finishing it i went back to read the introduction and found it incredible since it made me think critically about things i had read or notice stuff i missed as a bonus it also gave me desire to read it again youve earned a new subscriber from portugal looking forward to more videos,positive
you are so right the first reading is to get the idea and enjoy the book but if you stop there you never know what the book is really about not unless its a drugstore romance of course i fell absolutely in love with prousts writing luckily i can read french and reread my favorite passages in their original language thats when all the light bulbs went on i didnt realize it had as many plays on words in it he has so many clues to the theme that you dont see in english you just have to read things until you get them and like you i would say that three readings is just about right thanks for another great video,positive
i needed to hear this as im about to tackle some of thomas pynchons books please id love if you posted videos more regularly your content is amazing also could you maybe do a video talking about your experience reading in other languages because it can be frustrating to be facing a lot of unknown words and having to stop the rhythm of your reading i bet you have a lot of things to say about the subject thanks,positive
first of all i want to say that i am genuinely in love with your essays second i want to say that everything you say resonates in me in one way that i never experimented before maybe this channel is what i was looking for and thirdly thirdly i want to say that i will stop commenting right now and start to watch the video hahah,positive
these are really nice clips even though i doubt im really your target demographic having spent the last thirty years working full time in bookstores i was particularly taken with your take sorry on proust i had a very similar experience with thomas manns the magic mountain it took me three or four goes to get through it first time round but every time i started from the beginning again i was finding new stuff in it i hadnt noticed before and in the end taught myself enough german to be able to tackle it in the original which was hugely worthwhile and i still go back to it regularly proust is also great but there are large chunks of it i found really physically stifling and claustrophobic but if you read anything about his life story that makes perfect sense,positive

this series is spectacular ive never seen any catalouge of the intellectual history of mankind that even approaches the depth of meaning and scholarship youre building here im blown away and deeply grateful,positive
some of my favorite voltaire quotes this man was a genius being a bird aint all about flying and shitting from high places it requires twenty years for a man to rise from the vegetable state in which he is within his mothers womb and from the pure animal state which is the lot of his early childhood to the state when the maturity of reason begins to appear it has required thirty centuries to learn a little about his structure it would need eternity to learn something about his soul it takes an instant to kill him of all religions the christian should of course inspire the most tolerance but until now christians have been the most intolerant of all men religion began when the first scoundrel met the first fool uncertainty is an uncomfortable position but certainty is an absurd one if you have two religions in your land the two will cut each other’s throats but if you have thirty religions they will dwell in peace what can you say to a man who tells you he prefers obeying god rather than men and that as a result hes certain hell go to heaven if he cuts your throat behind every successful man stands a surprised motherinlaw it is an infantile superstition of the human spirit that virginity would be thought a virtue and not the barrier that separates ignorance from knowledge animals have these advantages over man they never hear the clock strike they die without any idea of death they have no theologians to instruct them their last moments are not disturbed by unwelcome and unpleasant ceremonies their funerals cost them nothing and no one starts lawsuits over their wills the human brain is a complex organ with the wonderful power of enabling man to find reasons for continuing to believe whatever it is that he wants to believe our wretched species is so made that those who walk on the welltrodden path always throw stones at those who are showing a new road every man is a creature of the age in which he lives and few are able to raise themselves above the ideas of the time despite the enormous quantity of books how few people read and if one reads profitably one would realize how much stupid stuff the vulgar herd is content to swallow every day i have wanted to kill myself a hundred times but somehow i am still in love with life this ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our more stupid melancholy propensities for is there anything more stupid than to be eager to go on carrying a burden which one would gladly throw away to loathe one’s very being and yet to hold it fast to fondle the snake that devours us until it has eaten our hearts away those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities the more i read the more i acquire the more certain i am that i know nothing it is forbidden to kill therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets god is a comedian playing to an audience too afraid to laugh,neutral

tip always start with reviews you can mix up their themes maybe one review didnt do this but the other didsee whats been strongly estbalished thru time and check if theyve mentioned controversial parts or gaps of your topic from this check recent past five yearjournals about these gaps and where do they stand also literature review is quite overwhelming at first given the large amount of information youre gonna see especially for the younger generation given their access to scihub which can put you in a psychological rut not just to comfort you but also as a professional tip— you dont need to write everything you know or everything about the topic coherence and transition that will support why your doing a specific study is more important moreover sufficient if you see an underlying pattern in terms of method or conclusion lets say among 35 studies try to explain this pattern in 1 paragraph you dont need to write how those authors got the results in detail unless you see a clash between two papers then maybe you can reevaluate their differences in method,neutral

this video has superb clarity but sometimes the simple things become the most overwhelming it is correct that we can break a literature review down to structural components but the modern students who i teach there are 500 on my university of york dissertation module are faced and burdened with limitless access to knowledge and the fields of literature become endless the student has to navigate a constant tension between chaos and order i find examples help so students can see the limits and horizons before them my students asked me to post examples up so this is what i did on my channel it was originally intended for my own students but there are now there for all to see good luck everyone dr mark egan,neutral

admittedly silly to subject milton and shakespeare to a kind of competition but this is well worth your time and effort the benefit of having talented professional actors reading the small bits of their works takes this endeavor far beyond the typical classroom experience truly enjoyable and enlightening,positive
the two scholars are amazing and the actors are sublime ive never felt so happy in my life yet so jealous of those in that conference room ive been clapping and cheering and crying all at once wow thank you,positive
very interesting discussion and amazing actingreading thank you for posting this,positive
as a dramatist shakespeare makes humans into important huge things milton seems to be making important huge things have a human personification it truly is comparing apples to oranges both are preeminent english lit masters and are distinguished in their own right enjoyable and enriching experience,positive
thank you intelligence squared for compiling the most brilliant instructive debate i have ever had the pleasure to view the entire show enhanced by the highly talented actors who played bit parts written by both of the 2 literary giants under discussion tonights show will become one of my lifes unforgettable experiences,positive
this was a lovely event worth it for the acting alone especially the remarkable rendition of the scene of eves awakening i do think the debate was played too much on shakespeares terms and turf in part because prof smith politely allowed it to stay there some thoughts biographical silence favours shakespeare about whom we know relatively little than milton whose remarkable life positions him uniquely to speak on matters of loss weakness aspiration perseverance hatred and love this was hardly raised so too historical context shakespeare comes clearly out of an elizabethan tradition laid out in part for him by writers like marlowe and codeveloped by writers like jonson milton obliterates the norms of mid17th century poetry with a literary iconoclasm surpassed only by his republicanism drama favours interiority and interiority here was presented as the sine qua non of literary greatness milton and most literary history would not have thought it so though the actors brilliantly depicted ms dramatic imagination in paradise lost his goal unlike shakespeares was not primarily to explore the contours of the human mind but to go beyond them his theme is not finally the human but the humaninthecosmos in short we judged here whether milton was better according to the criteria of shakespeare shakespeare will win that battle with anyone milton will sooner decline your crown and force you to ask whether youre asking the right questions in the first place,positive
harriet walter embodies so perfectly lady macbeth that its shocking at sight bravo,positive
imagine the rsc with all its talented actors producing an audiobook recordingdramatisation of paradise lost oh bliss,positive
a very important thing is left out i think shakespeare was aiming for a wide range of accessibility so that he could pay his bills he wrote for the ignorant barbarous ground ling and for the intellectual as well milton actually says in the opening invocation of book 7 of paradise lost still govern thou my song urania and fit audience find though few hes pretty aware that he wont be liked by a great number of people but wants to soar above th aonian mount anyhow,neutral
lady macbeth was stunning absolutely stunning her acting was on another level that’s passion for the work on an almost transcendental level she became that character man goosebumps,positive
id just like to point out that odysseus sleeping around was necessary for his survival if a powerful goddess like circe or calypso wants to have sex with you you dont have much choice if you reject them it could spell doom for you or your loved ones horny gods punishing mortals for denying them sex is a recurring theme throughout classical mythology,negative
the odyssey is homer unwriting the iliad when odysseus raids cheats and behaves generally like a iliadic hero he is at his weakest and at the beginning of his odyssey by the end he refuses to cheat on his wife with the incredible fantastic nausica he shows almost inhuman patience and selfcontrol in the face of the suitors abuse and he choses nostos over kleos the choice achilles couldnt stand to make whats more achilles himself discredits the entire premise of the iliad when odysseus sees him down in the land of the dead by saying that it is better to be the lowest slave than king among all the unnumbered dead and he doesnt lie to everyone he knows his cretan narratives are really important nonviolent defenses against a situation similar to agamemnon and clytemnestra,negative

i always loved the odyssey both in high school english and the movie to me it was one of the ultimate journey epics like lotr its just a very very long journey with a penultimate goal of returning home but with fun little adventures and trials along the way,positive

for an interesting read some people may want to check out the penelopiad by margaret atwood its a novel that was later turned into a play and tells the story of penelope in ithaca while odysseus was gone its an interesting contemporary view of a classical text,positive

pedro páramo by the mexican writer juan rulfo is one of the masterpieces of latin american literature it is considered the novel that inaugurated the literary subgenre of magical realism in latin america juan rulfos work finally gave me the path i was looking for to continue with my books” colombian nobel laureate gabriel garcía márquez confessed in an interview,positive
magical realism is not from colombia because the term is european in concoction however when european writers viewed the way latin american writers wrote they saw it as realism with a splash of magical they viewed these stories through a lens of exotification without realising that its all real and that its a description of the absurdities found in latin american societies if we think about what exotification is its about seeing whats mundane or normalized in one society and treating it as special or unique because one is not used to it its very much about ignorance and how what we dont understand can often appear magical as a result how these authors chose to tell the story is what mattered this is why magical realism in my opinion does not exist its a term created in ignorance and perhaps the literary term itself is the most magical part about the whole genre,neutral
i read a magical realism text for the first time in a magazine it told the story of three dragons who were adopted by a couple they raised them as if they were human the way the author narrated the passage of their age in childhood adolescence and even adulthood is comical and fantastic at the same time dragons fight mess do drugs get married divorce and die,positive
you forgot the most important and influential book of latin american magical realism the corner stone pedro paramo by mexican juan rulfo latin american writers influenced salman rushdie et al btw garcia marquez is a nobel prize laureate,positive

one hundred years of solitude i finished on the second try i could see unfortunate latin america all in despair and confusion invaded by foreign powers tony morrisons “beloved” i read long long time ago and i found its korean version too difficult to properly understand i enjoyed murakami haruki books too i used to dream a lot almost every night each dream that i had was exactly how true magical realism was i saw no reason ever to bother to read magical realism novels,neutral
excellent explanation i completely agree with your explanation of magic realism and also the idea that it is a post colonial resistance against eurocentrism but i think its scope is even bigger one aspect of magic realism is politically ideological that is the postcolonial stuff another aspect is challenging the constricted mentality created by strict adherence to materialisticscientific determinism this aspect is more philosophical and not just ethical like the ideological aspect but also epistemological or maybe even metaphysical ie it may draw our attention to fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the likes this is just my personal opinion,positive

as a student of literature i fully agree with what youre saying in this video i almost use the same exact same arguments when someone asks me why i study literature lol i love how you and your mum discuss literature so casually and playfully thats some real family goals right there,positive
why i read and what book i read depends on my mood or my aims sometimes i read for a bit of escapism other times it’s to learn sometimes it’s both i love it when a book teaches you something that you never realised or expected and it stays with you and even changes your way of thinking,positive
emma you have the best nonbook channel book channel on yt,positive
i think its down to your mindset there are some truly trash novels in existence but you can read something like normal people and take something away from it like what your mum said about her crime novels if you have a philosophicalanalyticallearning mindset then any book or even trash reality shows can be good places to apply and challenge your thoughts about other people and contemporary society a literature degree is a good place to learn to learn and really develop that analytical mindset and how to write essays but this can be accomplished through so many other degrees also,neutral
“i think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us if the book were reading doesnt wake us up with a blow to the head what are we reading for so that it will make us happy as you write good lord we would be happy precisely if we had no books and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to but we need books that affect us like a disaster that grieve us deeply like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves like being banished into forests far from everyone like a suicide a book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us that is my belief” this quote by kafka perfectly illustrates why we need books to challenge and disrupt us cerebrally if we’re reading only for entertainment where else in our lives are we finding that sector of learning and stimulation that phenomenal books provide us with,neutral

i read mostly non fiction books on random topics that interest me currently reading a book on artists and architects since lockdown been watching a lot of documentaries on artists and galleries so i got a book on the topic unfortunately it’s about 700 pages which almost put me off but out of pride i couldn’t give up only to become fascinated by how all these buildings that were built for people are no longer there so who do these objects serve this book was written in 2017 with an international look as these creators to encapsulate both artists and architects in a series of interviews have to explain their method some are coy but those willing to share open up this view of how they see the world in relation to the notion of space if i understood correctly each creator seeks to capture and reflect this moment in time for future generations to understand their time,neutral
when you read a novel how much do you focus on the text vs the background of the author for instance one of my favorite books is the master and margarita by mikhail bulgakov if you read it by itself it is such an interesting novel however learning the history of its writing in the background of stalins russia makes it even more interesting how much time should we dedicate to looking beyond the four corners if at all,positive
i usually pick up a book for two reasons either because i like to see what it would be like to live in a different reality and that is why i read a lot of fantasy and horror or because i want to know how it is like to live and think as a certain person or in a certain place and time for that is when i go to classics and more international literature also i totally agree with the people should read classics thing its so cool when you read a classic and finally get this book that keeps being referenced everywhere and you understand why that book has been read for generations,positive

here is the transcript the literature review is not an essay it is not a research paper the literature review is part of your essay the literature review is part of your research paper or maybe standalone product if youre masters degree or doctoral degree program and you have to do that for but regardless of whether part of the research essay or standalone product one thing the literature review does not do is it doesn’t prove state illustrate collaborate or develop your main point thats in the body of your essay the literature review does not do that it does not provide the body or development section up your affect or your paper well what the heck does it do then well the literature review is divided into the following key terms first is the whole idea of what the heck in the literature the literature is simply those major works that have been published about your narrow topic now remember i said narrow topic we are not going to be reviewing every published thing on a broad topic like steroid use by athletes you could have a more narrow topic like steroid use by high school affiliates or steroid use by baseball players into you going to be reviewing the major works just on that narrow topic thats the first thing that you need to know the literature is published peer reviewed sources on in narrow topic second thing the literature review is that narrow topic in all those sources published on it are going to be reviewed what the heck of a review well review is simply a way of looking at something in taking a snapshot of it what is that snapshot going to capture that snapshot going to capture major concepts the major point the major outcome the major whatever in that source it’s not going to be a detailed write up of that source going to be a snapshot once you get all those snapshot done you going to show the relationship between those snapshot and talking about those relationships you probably going to be pulling them in some kind of timeline situation maybe not but the key years is you’re going to be extracting just the major element in then relationship among those major element may be on a time line type of situation now the next thing to know about them going to reviewers why theyre hack are you doing all this stuff well i think there are three reasons probably why youre doing all this stuffs in school in the first one off course to improve your own understanding as an undergraduate researcher coming into these topics into this discipline on the undergraduate level when the first link to you have to do is to build your understanding build your background build your expertise in a particular discipline in subject in that discipline then in of course in this paper when you have built your expertise in your knowledge in this particular subject youre going to be demonstrating that knowledge demonstrating that expertise to your professor because this is a college assignment but you know the real purpose of a literature review is it’s a reader service it something you doing as a favor for your readers what are you doing you are bringing them up to date what’s the first thing you and that old friend do you ask each other hey what you been doing all these years fill me in update me you doing the same thing in a literature review you feeling them in you updating them by bringing them up to date then you can start at the present again you see what i’m saying you can bring them along that timeline of the path letting them know the key element the major concepts the key element in your life and what you dare boom then you can start and that the dividing line between the literatures review in the rest of your paper the development you go all their ideas past scholars the past researchers boom and then come your idea,negative

i love how these guys are out here making the forts that we all wanted as kids,positive
awesome project guys but why not just put a hinge on the secret door so the bed would still be usable or maybe put a hydraulic platform so you can lift the bed and enter the secret room without actually putting a hole in the bed just my thoughts,positive

i read about a man in his 50s that started investing in stocks then retired in 2years with over 6million that right there is my utmost goal and id really appreciate clues and tips on how to reach this goal within 5years,positive
thanks for the tip jim going to finally open a long position on bbby,positive

little does he know the ape will not going to let this happen,negative
inverse cramer time to buy bbby,neutral
cramer hitting the coke in the morning,neutral
its nice to see these very quick unscripted breaking news type of videos,positive
good summation my only disagreement is with the part where you say investors chose bbby in jan 21 because it was highly shorted my understanding is its part of a basket of stocks all shorted with the same instrument and all retail companies movie theatre used game store towels and when gme went parabolic the covering that occurred on that single security pushed up the whole basket i cant talk for other investors but very little of the rest of the basket was mentioned on reddit prior to the last week of jan 21 sure since becoming bagholders people think its a movement but to start with it was a value play when i went long gme was 918 pre split with 12 book value when i went long bbby it was 498 with huge call option interest at 5 and ryan cohen had skin in the game its fine playing meme stocks but i suggest getting in when the chatter is low and if ryan cohen is involved make sure your cost basis is less than his ,neutral

if you don’t do something about your financial situation your income remains unchanged while expenditures keep rising these got me seeking the best answers to invest my 50k any ideas here,negative
i think more than anything the meme stock phenomenon is a protest against the vitriol exhibited towards the retail investor with that said i do and like having a small portion of my portfolio reserved for speculation having made some good money off of picks like amc and bbby it’s small enough where it doesn’t hurt my long term investment goals and strategy and large enough to “have fun” with as long as you don’t put more down than you’re willing to lose and fully acknowledge it’s a casino have fun with it just be safe set your stop limits and take profit as you go not financial advice just how i conduct myself,positive
note bbby is on vendor credit watch which means bbby have to pay for goods in adavance,neutral
ah bbby yes thank you i threw in a little bit of money and ended up tripling it thank you i am too wimpy to go big but i am happy with the small win never throw a large sum into something this volatile,positive

thanks for this owen watching this guy lose his poop constantly on one hand is entertaining but he is doing real damage to unsuspecting people who have fallen for his rhetoric as a christian people like him make the saner ones among us cringe constantly i do not expect everyone to believe but we all have to live together and need to treat everyone with dignity human kindness there is no place in our society for this kind of hate,negative

is this an alternate gibi universe timeline where gibi actually liked the planes that flew over her house so much that she decided to become a flight attendant,neutral
as an ex flight attendant this is incredibly detailed especially the safety demo gave me flashbacks i wish i had been able to give the demo in a way as calming as you were,positive
i love how when gibi asks for options she doesnt specify which one we pick for example she asks which one would you like then she says okay perfect and no matter what someone picks it seems really interactive also love the attention to detail with the airplane cups thanks so much for the relaxation and content you provide for us 3,positive
id love a everything is wrong version of this with us the viewers being the only ones on the flight and were in a rusty old plane that could drop at any given point perhaps daisy could be the flight attendant,positive
fun fact most aeroplanes have above head “cabins” for the crew to sleeprest in during flights that’s why you might not see a specific crew member for a certain amount of time they’re probably up there my mom is a flight attendant so i get all this information from her don’t worry it’s the real stuff,neutral
the attention to detail is unmatched the background noise the safety demonstration even the cups were like aeroplane cups,positive
i don’t even have any allergies but the consciousness of allergens is so comforting idk why  i know it’s really scary traveling with allergies for you gibi so i can imagine how nice it would be to hear those words from a flight attendant,positive
i made timestamps lol use them if you want to sorry if they are not precisely correct 000 welcometodays sponsor 356 a little safety demonstration 820 flight attendant coming to check on you 835 turning on sleepmode at your screen 924 offering you something to drink 958 sparkling water tapping bubble and water sounds 1148 choosing your tea flavour 1426 making you tea tapping paper and water sounds 1521 giving you a hot towel 1558 info about the snack basket and breakfast 1657 going through the breakfast menu with you and checking if you have any allergies 1853 going through the snack basket 2022 showing you your grooming kit 2449 showing you the in seat buttons and the tv stuff lol 2628 getting you ready to sleep 2839 good night,neutral
the safety demonstration is one of my favorite in real life asmr triggers i always look forward to it and watch very intently on flights lol so i’m very happy to have this video to watch on repeat  the lighting and attention to detail is just flawless gibi you’re incredible,positive
the first first class flight attendant roleplay from many moons ago is still one of my favorites to this day and gives me the best asmr i love theseeee ,positive

i saw on gibis twitter that this video made the person who subtitled it fall asleep and after watching it theres no wonder why i almost did the same but i got to the end cause i didnt want to miss anything all these soft relaxing sounds were so good  i especially enjoyed the plush watermelon borrowed from satine the small brush and all the whispering of course thank you gibi ,positive

lattes eyes are so kind it’s like she’s saying “it’s ok i’m here” just by eye contact,positive
the fact that the windows get darker progressively is a sign of how attentive to detail latte is amazing work,positive
latte would you ever consider doing a behind the scenes of your asmr filming process i am so fascinated by how detailed your sets are how perfect you make them and how you embody every aspect of the role you’re playing for these asmr videos it’s incredible i’d love to see a behind the scenes of you setting up and filming i think many others would too ,positive
latte is so incredible i am a teen and struggle with anxiety depression ocd adhd paranoia body dysmorphia and gender dysphoria ptsd and dissociative issues as well as chronic pain so it is usually very difficult for me to feel relaxed and fall asleep i discovered latte two years ago and it changed my life she is so soothing and comforting without being condescending annoying or repetitive and her videos are always incredibly high quality i’ve watched all of her videos including the ones in languages i don’t understand and there wasn’t a single video i didn’t like i love and appreciate latte so much 33,positive
the airline realness here is out of this world the white china the way the food is plated the picture on the back wall its just outstanding,positive
i and hopefully other people would love to see a “behind the scene” of the making on of these videos,positive
this woman is one of the few asmr tists who got exactly the concept and mastered the practice some asmrtists as fine as they are do not have the sensibility to sometimes avoid some triggers or noises that can actually bother the most sensitive listeners there are patterns of sounds which means some sounds will cause relaxation other sounds might bother one same person and many youtubers dont realize that these cannot be mixed me for an example hate very high pitched noises hate plastic and eating sounds latte could never have a disturbing plastic noise on her videos she just knows whats up,negative
whenever you tell us to breathe in and breathe out it instantly relaxes me you are the only asmr person that has given me complete relaxation in such a simple manner your voice is just perfect for this,positive
latte is so passionate she even bought a plane for us ,positive
omg i just noticed that the sun is setting outside the windows… the attention to detail latte puts into every video is just incredible,positive

read me i forgot to answer the first question on the screen im sorry my answer is id rather pick talk to animals even if it wasnt a perfect communication would be unbelievable to be the only person who could do that sorry hope yall see this before getting mad at me for skipping it lol also i reference asmr galaxys channel if you love watching would you rathersipad sounds this video is directly inspired from theirs definitely check them all out so many great videos,positive
your handwriting is so amazing it’s actually visual asmr for me,positive
omg now you gotta make this into a series your ipad videos i remember the first one with testing out brushes was the reason why i started my asmr channel now i’m expecting a large series with 5 parts of would you rather lovely you’re the best  thank you for the mention i don’t think i even deserve it ,positive
love so much that youre a jojo fan what a relaxing video i love the tapping sounds,positive
my life is complete knowing that gibi has used one of my examples lol ,positive
can we just talk about how nice gibi’s handwriting is,positive
couldn’t get enough of the ipad tapping sounds these questions were great would like a sequel possibly with some original characters would be interesting to see officer barts answers to some of these questions,positive
it’s currently midnight even though i’m so tired i know it’s worth it and i already know it will love your vids keep em up and goodnight everyone,positive
the ipad tapping sounds really good the writing too i really like this background since it helps me watch it before i sleep,positive
hope yall see this before getting mad at me for skipping it lol i personally wouldnt get mad for something like that  but still im glad ive read the description first before watching the video like i always do ,positive
my mom used to play one of these with me ours was growing a vegetable patch you would till the soil and make the rows then planting the seeds and naming each type of veggie as you went then covering the seeds with dirt and then rain falling over them all and sunshine shining on them to help them grow tt u tt very good childhood memories indeed these were great to listen to thank you so much for sharing and triggering a lot of us in the best of ways,positive

some little time stamps 3 230 treasure island  658 kittens  935 cool winter night  1218 happy birthday  1406 beach ,positive
i love the clear visible and audible pleasure erin takes in lines like its a snake and it attacks,positive
i havent thought of these since my mom passed away when i was young since she used to this to help me sleep at night this was really relaxing and these were so nice to hear again,positive
the nostalgia on this was off the charts my earliest asmr experience as a kid along with playing with hair were these back tracing games,positive
the version we did as kids where i live was honestly a bit weird the direct translation would be three knives to the back blood runs down spiders crawling in your hair snakes round your neck crack an egg on your head and the yolk runs down and then youd usually say boo or something maybe lightly push the person as youre saying it too so yea pretty hardcore for a bunch of 6 year olds lol,negative
such a nostalgic thing for me my mom used to help me sleep with these every other night in my country we call them wierszykimasażyki which roughly translates to massage poems loved the video,positive
this stuff is so interesting my version of the shiveries was so much shorter and had like half of the same elements its cool how much these things change from place to place and time to time,positive
“there’s an egg on your head and the yolk is running down … there’s a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down” “i’m sleeping with pam’s mom sometimes dinner”,negative
hi all i hope you enjoyed d if you want more videos of the characters ill link here daisy lorelei sybil luna mistletoe bart robyn pompom fleeb florb tatyana sybil bart daisy and lorelei give you manicures ps if you want to see the signature page ill post it on my ig story,positive
now this truly is the gibiverse of madness,neutral
being a british person myself gibi an american actually did a good job of doing a fairly convincing english accent as robyn literally never thought id say an american would ever do that but there ya go edit thanks for 12k likes,positive
i love that robyns signature is literally an x marks the spot,positive
sybil giving us some tea and essentials for the road is the cutest thing ever shes so mumsy and this is why i love her shes probably my favourite character in the gibiverse ,positive
no one talking about pompom shes like someone who would sit and listen to you while in your darkest moments and when your bored she always has good ideas to help you i love pompom and love to see more of her and lorelei too,positive
the fact that no one’s talking abt luna saying “want a quickie oh i shouldn’t say that”,negative
can i say bart is just an amazing addition to gibis world of characters,positive
daisy dont say hi to lorelei i owe her money pov character goes to lorelei first and gives her a paper that says daisy and nothing else damn we savage,negative
the most impressive thing about this video is the fact that each character has their own thought out and individual signature thats some ace character creation,positive
leave a thumbs up for your favorite trigger and goodnight,positive
let the anxiety melt away let the overthinking stop for awhile you deserve relaxation you deserve comfort be kind to yourself please ,positive
her nails be on point every single video and it’s so satisfying,positive
the bassy sound of the lint comb is so unique its a weird but wonderful cross between a cat purring and a frog croaking,positive
your nail tapping has the most unique sound but the quality of your asmr is what stands out the most it is by far one of my essential can’t live without nightly routines,positive

the usps store in my hometown is atleast the times ive been in there very quiet and simple the workers are soft spoken and sweet and i cant even remember music being played really its not an awkward quiet but a comforting one with a little bit of paper shuffling background noise,positive
her whisper voice is so clicky and precise and perfect and it’s so relaxing i’ve never heard another asmrtist with such a satisfying natural voice,positive
gibi the answer is always yes we like everything you do we want all the vids ,positive

your rps are out of this world amazing i’m still vibing from the trojan war medical muselyre player but as this video shows and as we all know just “plain” gibi excuse the oxymoron isn’t too bad either excuse the understatement thanks for the zs edit follows actually i should not say gibi’s role plays are “out of this world” they are in this world they portray pieces of who we are or want to be or pieces of people we know or want to know or of people we have met or want to meet or of friends or personal assistants we have or want to have and this is just one reason why they are so amazing,positive

listening to this with earbuds for the first time in a long time and it’s rly a whole new experience it’s soooo good  edit i used to listen to asmr without any earphones and was fine for once i thought about using them pls don’t be weird in the comments lol,positive

i was dying laughing at all the background noise even then i loved your reaction to it honestly it wasn’t even that bad,positive
the fuck off had me dying i always love your follow instructions videos,positive
150 made me feel that tingly feeling between my eyes it was perfect,positive
the background noise actually added to the comfort for me because i felt like i was just hanging with a old friend at their place in the real world the imperfection makes things feel safe,positive
when you dont cut out background noises but use them as your advantage is the way of a true asmrtist,negative
getting that raven feel with your hair color from teen titans it looks rad love it ,positive

im chineseaustralian and i started thinking about what my ideal comfort food would be when i started watching this video it turned out that i had a very similar experience with the chinese lady in this video as well my parents sometimes made congee with cabbage and chicken in the morning and it was the best meal i could ever have wanted i also requested this when i was sick and also when i got braces on because i could only eat soft foods it really shows just how nice this mixture of rice and water really is,positive
my comfort food is maggibeing an indian i literally grew up eating ityou can just eat it anytimeevery indian loves it,positive
im filipino and my favorite comfort food is called bananacue its basically banana covered with crunchy caramel but typically we dont use just normal bananas we use a kind of banana called sabah and its like banana but bigger and a little bit firmer typically served on a stick but its up to you on how you want it served,positive

i dont know why everyone is disliking the british one for me i think comfort foods means that you can have it all the time whether youre happy sad tired exhausted or energetic personally i dont even like bread and toast but for him it might be his comfort food which he can have it all the time whenever he wants to without even thinking about the preparations to make for a grand food xx,negative
being british the best comfort food is at chinese takeaway their bbq sweet ribs are perfect they fall off the bone and you get to eat the sweet crunchy cartilage and if you like it the bone marrow it’s perfect to eat and the sauce in the tub left over in thick and sweet and perfect for the chips they sell that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside hope i described it well edit also marmite and cheese inbetween 2 pieces of toast just jjejjsjsjsjsjjssjisisjenjd,positive
a fellow mexican here and i have two different comfort foods for when i want something sweet i go with arroz con leche because its good for any time of the day and can be eaten cold or hot which means its good for literally any time of the year and my other comfort food is definitely pozole it is just so good and warm and it gives me memories of all the parties i went to when i was a child,positive

as a native chicagoan i can safely say portillos is pretty great the italian beef and their crinkle fries are both so so good however as someone who visits missouri yearly you can never say no to lions choice it puts arbys to shame with real roast beef gotta get it with swiss and au jus with a fountain ibc root beer it doesn’t get much better than that,positive

i was born and raised in anchorage and i can all but guarantee you that while tommys is atbest pretty standard its an absolute tourist trap and has been since i was born in 1993 go to long branch saloon for burgers and if you want a more alaskan experience try to go for a salmon quesadilla from salmon express during saturday market my recommendation is to order it spicy but even getting a regular is going to be excellent even if youre not big on seafood,positive
went to north carolina for my cousins wedding back in october 2018 mentioned that we were going to go to bojangles the following day we had two people at our table that were close friends of the bride and groom the groom being my cousin they immediately got excited and told us we had to go there it holds the record for being the only place whose biscuits i love i am a native seattleite and have had likely hundreds if not thousands of dicks burgers fries and shakes throughout my life in high school we had them for lunch every saturday good times good times,positive

im from md and can confirm our love of blue crabs albeit most people i know would rather get a dozen steamed crabs and pick it themselves than get a crabcake just because picking crabs on the bay is a fun nostalgic activity i suppose crab cakes are usually preferred by touristspeople who want to stay cleancivilized meals haha seriously though if you come to md in the summer go to cantlers or mikes crab house near the bay bridge you wont be dissapointed,positive
as someone who grew up in new jersey i do love salt water taffy but sub sandwiches are the real iconic food from nj the term submarine sandwich was coined in my hometown of paterson by an italian immigrant thanks wikipedia white house subs in atlantic city is one of the jersey shores oldest sub shops and of course the jersey mikes chain started from in pt pleasant yes your local deli probably makes a better sandwich but jms subs are at least far superior to subway,positive

born and raised in sc never had a low country boil i thought itd be shrimp and grits it doesnt look bad but probably something youd find more on the coast specifically charleston than inner state and ive noticed nc is more known for their vinegar based sauce than their tomato based used to work for a bbq restaurant so thats just my experience from outoftowners,neutral

nikhil had so much energy and was actually trying the food makes me want to travel to india just for the mcds food,positive
i love that basically everything has a vegetarian option in india i’m kind of jealous,positive
the thing that was not mentioned in the video is that there are two mcdonalds in india north and east zone run by connaught foods and south and west run by hardcastle foods the menus for both of them are different meaning each of them have their own exclusives i think nikhil was having the south and west mcdonalds they have a bigger menu compared to north and east indian laws donot allow foreign companies to hold 100 of business in india they are required to partner up with a local company so mcdonalds partners with connaught foods and hardcastle foods dominos with jubilant foods yum brands partner with devyani international sapphire foods and more recently burman hospitality starbucks with tata coffees etc so the local companies do get a say in the menus which is why the menus may be different at different places in india,neutral
what nikhil says from 2300 is absolutely right it might seem its cheap to the foreign viewers but in reality it is actually quite expensive for the indian population,neutral
there are actually 2 extremely different mcdonald’s menu’s in india i am from north india and over there most of the things are different from the menu shown in the video edit the comments are actually telling me that there are two official distributors of mcdonald’s in india and because of that the menu’s vary drastically which is pretty interesting actually and you guys could do a food wars seasonspin off showing the regional differences between fast food chains in india itself,positive
nikhil is genuinely the best person to represent indian food on global media he knows his shit and how to accurately talk about indias various socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds,positive
i love how crystelles part was a really serious and well presented historygeography lesson and they cut to nikhil just be like its like crack lmfao,positive
kinda want to try indian mcdonalds after this the masala potato wedges and the other sides look pretty good and the paneer burgers would be fun to try,positive

dominos india used to do twisties twistie bread they used to be these long braided dough with garlic butter and oregano seasoning brushed on top long time back they were an off menu item and the cheapest thing at dominos these teiesties were decentralized and being a broke college student the twisties helped me a lot,positive
i love how brutal the commentary is in this one its about time somebody puts dominos in its place i never really understood why people like them so much but to each their own i guess its just too bad they have no appreciation on what qualifies as food worth paying for btw nikhil is so funny i hope you have him on more often,negative
i have wanted to visit india forever to experience authentic indian food it’s my favorite cuisine but based on these videos i’m almost tempted to go just to try the indianized version of our crappy american fast food that i never eat in the states the curiosity is kind of killing me now ,negative
dominos india have deteriorated a lot over the years their cheese burst doesnt burst anymore stuffed garlic bread doesnt have cheese in it and most importantly they dont use cheese anymore its all vegoil based cheese substitute even their customer care and store staffs are not as good as before i used to love dominos before but now its a nightmare,negative
ive been living in india for almost 10 years now and prefer its pizzas much over the western menu i still remember my first year in india seeing a big dominos ad where theyd advertise two new pizzas with exotic vegetables the exotic vegetables being broccoli and zuccini goes to show that exotic is very much a question of perspective,positive
fyiwe also have garlic breadsticks stuffed garlic breadcheese dominator1 pound of mozzarella cheese melted on the pizza5 cheese pizza1 out of those 4 cheeses is a ghost pepper flavoured cheeseparatha pizzared velvet lava cake and butterscotch mousse cakewhich is the most heavenly thing available on the whole dominos menu but its also true that these items are region specific thats why it is there in kolkatawest bengal but not in bangalore,positive
loving this series we get such boring dominos pizzas here in the uk the us pizzas looked good the indian ones were interesting to see i’d really like to try that apple dip and cinnamon sugar dough dessert from the us and the indian chocolate lava cake looked yummy,positive

ive only known george for 22 minutes but hes too precious,positive
when i lived in japan about 17 years ago macdonalds had a burger called the mcgrand it had a creamy dijon mustard sauce and a thick beef patty along with lettuce tomatoes and so on it was so good that i still think about it occasionally i was really disappointed when i moved back to canada and it wasnt on the menu here,positive
the japanese packaging is cute i’m also surprised mcfloats aren’t a thing here but the ice cream machines are always down so maybe that’s a factor,positive
i used to work as a manager at mcdonald’s in canada and i also travel to japan often so when i do get mcdonald’s in japan i often like to try something different there it’s been a few years since i last went partly due to covid… but i tried the locomoco burger and hawaii blue drink and both were pretty good oh and the teriyaki burgers are pretty good,positive
coming from a person who’s from hawaii i’m surprised we don’t have some of the hawaiian stuff that japan has lol as for the us side missed the chance to add the hawaii breakfasts,neutral
also who thinks they should send me to tokyo to try the exclusives irl that’d be a good series right,positive
funny to see a teriakyi burger i cant have tomatoes due to gerd and other issues so i tried to find a replacement to sauce my burgers with i tried teriyaki on my homemade hamburger and it was a great alternative funny enough japans mcdonalds does the same thing lool my at home one was fantastic so i have no doubt they love it,positive
the japanese saucepackaging is awesome this is probably the coolest thing ive ever seen at mcdonalds,positive
a number of years ago mcd did a limited global menu thing where they brought a few of their international exclusives to the us i think the only thing they ever did before quitting it that i remember was a burger from spain and a stroopwafel mcflurry from the netherlands i dont remember trying the spanish burger it really wasnt anything that different the stroopwafel mcflurry was awesome tho was sad to see it go anyway i knew a little bit about the japanese exclusive items and was hopeful theyd continue it and do a run with a few of those here the mcteriyaki burger sounds awesome and im surprised they havent tried the mcfloats here ice cream floats are a classic dessert in the us and it would be so easy a dr pepper mcfloat would be really good for us taste im also kind of upset they ditched the snack wraps probably a us exclusive you could have showcased here had they still been around they had 3 that i remember big mac a barbecue crispy chicken one and i think a bacon ranch one wrapped in the same sized tortilla as the breakfast burrito i think you got 2 per order and they were a perfectly sized fast hot snack if thats what one was hungry for on the go,positive

food insider hit the jackpot with nikhil as the host for indian food he does a really good job i have one request and that is that you dont waste food by throwing it out after taking just one bite and instead cut off a piece from where you took the bite and offer it to someone who doesnt have food itll make that persons day and you wouldnt lose a thing,positive
i can see how this would be a western option nice bland easy on the palate broooo lol if you flavor something we are buying at a restaurant with salt pepper we call that a rip off it needs at least 10 spices lmaoooo i feel that though ,neutral
i remember getting in line for a subway at delhi int airport there was a line of say 6 people of which 4 were nonindians i was getting late and the line seemed huge i was also wondering why so many foreigners were eating vegetarian then one of them got in the front and the cashier told him that the nonveg line was on the other side and then they looked up and spotted that they were standing in the vegetarian line the entire queue moved and i got my sub in time for my flight fun times,positive

mark you found the right guy to bring you around kf seetoh is a legend in singapore,positive
yummy street food i like those foods ,positive
for those who dont know kf seetoh is a legendary street food critic in singapore he has really shine light on the traditional cooking methods and food culture and guided the likes of anthony bourdain etc through his long career i also personally respect that he does not put on airs or care about visuals the way other singaporean food influencers do he really cares 100 about the food edited for grammar,positive
incredible job on that video he is an icon to local food and has been pushing hard to promote the industry i think you found the right man to introduce singapore hawker food i saved almost 90 on my flights using mighty  travels  premium,positive
this gentleman seetoh made this video a delight usually i watch everything you do expecting your take on certain foods this man had amazing knowledge of expressly singaporian dishesand it was extraordinary thank you,positive
love the fact that hes able to give us the history behind all the singapore favorites he was also a friend of anthony bourdain if you bourdain fans may recall,positive
such a joy to watch kf seetoh his passion for the local food scene the way he celebrates the hawkers and food stall owners couldnt stop smiling the entire video 2948 was touching love the guy,positive
glad that mark chose to work with seetoh someone who has lived the 70s80s someone who has tasted and knows how authentic singapore streethawker food in the 70s80s were like and how they were authentically prepared and the ingredients originally used in that erathings that young people wouldnt know,positive
as a singaporean im so glad to see kf seetoh introduce all the food in less wellknown not the chinatown complex hong lim or golden mile hawker centres thats locally loved,positive

so apparently the japanese 7elevens are like mini togo restaurants while the ones in the us serve packaged processed food or reheated frozen processed garbage its almost an insult to call them the same store how do we let them get away with this crap here,negative
i dont think ive ever seen such a stark difference in selection and quality on a food wars ep before lol,neutral
theres no comparison between us 7 elevens and the 711 in asia dramatic difference on quality of food and service for ppl who live in the us and want to experience the asia 711s go to hawaii 711s are run by different companies in asia which explains the significant difference as an american i barely go to 711 except if i need a drink food is mostly unedible unless ur drunk high or dont care,negative
it seems in this series that george enjoys what he eats way more than joe does 3,positive
i’m upset that japan’s 711 has actual proper food where we have nothing but junk food anyways i’m excited that you guys are branching out to india,positive
me as a european am always so surprised about the drink sizes in the us how can the smallest soda be 651ml that would in the netherlands be enough for the entire family i mean in japan they have 1l and 15 liter packages but they are clearly to pour in glasses and share they arent portion sized,negative
the japanese chocolate doughnut looks much better than the one you’d get in america or here in the uk,positive
george is always saying how “yummy” everything was so when he said “it tastes like st” i almost fell off my chair lmfao ,positive

mooshelle was really sucking it in for that fancy pants dance with chase,negative
i started thinking that moochelle looked like chase this episode then rhett said chase isnt moochelle and then chase and moochelle danced together so im glad we put that to rest so efficiently and definitively,positive
the fact that rhett doesn’t like big shrimp then proceeds to choose it at the end makes me laugh he knew it was fancy,neutral
honestly nothing has tempted me into joining the mythical society until the counseling session teaser,neutral
that therapist is a true professional to be able to hold it together with someone intentionally being like randy and treating it like any other session is admirable,positive

would love to travel the  and eat food like mark his love for food and the culture and stories behind the dishes absolutely beautiful,positive
the genius of mark’s videos is his ability to take deep dives into countries and truly convey his experience after seeing james blick here i got hooked on his vlog just like i how i found joel’s and jlj’s vlog don’t change anything mark don’t go cable network or public television…just keep doing what you do,positive

i love how his son let his dad rage at him knowing he needed to do it and being proud that he did it,positive
i ate here as a kid before during and after the filming of this episode my dad is vegan so we went here often the food was always great and the son was who my family usually interacted with he was always super nice you could imagine my surprise when i got older and saw this episode lol i never saw gordon ramsay but i saw the son and staff being interviewed one of the times my family went for breakfast the potato pancake was my favorite on the menu its a shame the restaurant was sold and no longer exists,positive
this man is a very gentle soul its hard for him to get angry,positive
this is a really good episode lots of great moments the son getting excited about his dad standing up for himself the owner secretly shaking the pan while handcuffed the owner eating the plants straight from the pot a fun time,positive
so wonderful to see that guy love his dad so much that he wasnt even disturbed with his dad yelling at him recognised that it was apart of his dads growth as a manager and got so excited by it happening,positive
the owner in this episode is such a sweetheart bless his heart its sad that some of his staff take advantage of that im so glad gordon came to help and i hope they clean up their act and kick it into gear i really hope that after gordon leaves that dean will continue to put his foot down and have the restaurant and life he deserves to be completely honest the cook showed promise but he didnt show up half of the time when he needed to and didnt listen to dean and wants to say dean is a bad manthats ridiculous dean put up with orelio cookchef thinking he can do what he wants mainly deans own fault and so now that is what he expects i would have fired his ass a long time ago,neutral
the son of the owner was very well spoken and respectful i really loved how he was honest with his dad but also showed a caring side as well,positive
i would literally eat here the owner was so respectful you could tell he has a big heart and willing to do what he can to improve the restaurant hes definitely not arrogant and takes criticism well,positive
the owner is so down to earth humble and nice if this is my boss i would literally work longer in that restaurant,positive
i respect everyone who were involved in this seriously the best piece that ive ever seen on youtube hats off to you all love your videos ,positive

chef john always coming through with the best stoner food,positive
im going to comment this on every potato video to simplify the destarching of your potato whether its for chips fries hash browns or whatever use a solidbottom salad spinner fill it with water swish your potato pieces lift out the basket and dump and refill the water until its clear then dump the water and spin the potatoes you will get them super dry in just a minute then you can lay them out on a kitchen towel or paper towel but this will save you paper towels because they will be dry of course there is no reason you must use my technique after all you are the johnny depp of your potato prep enjoy,neutral
i have been coming back chef johns recipes then and again for years theres always great nuggets of advice and reasons to chuckle in these videos thank you once again chef,positive
i’m allergic to sunflower seeds and most storebought potato chips are cooked in sunflower oil so this opens up my life to potato chips thank you chef john,positive
the only problem is avoiding eating the first batch while the second cooks i place my chips on parchment without the dinner plate i also toss them in oil without rinsing them my 1100w microwave takes 3 minutes per batch also you can get a variance of 50 with the time required depending on the potato itself always keep an eye on it and never assume the time will be the same,neutral
chef john from beef wellington to potato chips in the microwave the man does it all,positive
i had to come back to say this works great i used olive oil spray though and lawrys season salt but same result very crunchy only 6 minutes in my micro so as chef john said watch them because everyones micro is different also kudos to the parchment paper trick to cut it round but i think i did one too many folds because i ended up with 2 parchment paper circles attached together ,positive
these look amazing  i hate the fact that store bought crisps im watching from the uk or chips are broken up into little pieces due to handling i guess thanks for sharing,positive
for years now i have had this overwhelming frustration when watching chef johns videosi just wanna give em more than one thumbs up such a legend,neutral

from a home cook perspective a lot of this makes sense seasoning mayo tastes nice and is easy to do which makes up for its short shelf life the dragon fruit is novel but also tasteless that makes the taste of the official product worrying makes you wonder if everything has just gone off,neutral
the gov’t must order her to stop the sale of this immediately especially if it’s that perishable and not shipped properly,negative

philipino cuisine is criminally underrated i’m mexican american from so california and believe it or not i went my first 23 years of my life never having had the pleasure of trying it outside of a few random delicious desserts from my aunt’s filipina coworkers wasn’t until i started dating a half filipina half white girl i first got to try it at a legit restaurant i absolutely loved everything my family would always tease me for putting vinegar and salt on pretty much anything and when i realized spicy vinegar was a normal everyday table condiment i felt like i found my long lost relatives haha that alone would have been enough for me but then dessert absolutely sealed the deal… halohalo… are you kidding me filipinos that is crack cocaine in dessert form and everything else all of the sweet sticky rice flour balls filled with coconut and ube purple sweet yam and taro i love my mexican food and while i wouldn’t ever trade it for anything filipino food seriously gives it a run for its money in my opinion,positive
nice to see you back in the philippines enjoying trying filipino dishes sonny ,positive
sonny you should try the adobo version of cooked frogs with tons of red small chili and garlic prepared by our very own locals its delicious,positive
i love that philipibes reminds me of my coubtry mexico the crickets here in mexico are prepared deliciously as well,positive
this man is the man he has more knowledge about filipino food than my fellow filipinoa whos in this video edit wala naman po ako sinabing pangit kay ate gurl pinuri ko lang yung vlogger haha,positive
the side dish is called smoked shotgun shells its been super popular for the last couple of years on a lot of bbq channels and at bbq competitions,positive
guga needs to have december simply be a best of month where he spends an entire month redoing some of his easier best experiments and comparing what the best experiments of the year were i would love that,positive
judging by angel and leos reactions it seems like gugas cooking just gets better and better every video,positive
that movie theater butter flavor is thanks to something called “butter salt” brand name flavicol the compounds that give butter it’s buttery taste can be made artificially or extracted from actual butter then mixed with salt as a powder this is then mixed with oil and that’s what movie theaters use you should dry age with the pure flavicol powder — i bet that’d be incredible,positive
has anyone mentioned that this bbq sauce looks fantastic will you tell us how you made it guga,positive
hey guga we know that dry brining steak is actually good so what if try dry aged steak using garlic powder and black pepper and lets see if it will work and will taste much better ,positive
popcorn oil is amazing i used to work at a movie theater and we’d pop the kernels by adding one pump of oil into the hopper one day i added a second pump of oil and the popcorn was amazing perfect golden color savory delicious people complimented how good the popcorn was i became the guy responsible for making all the popcorn one day i showed a coworker my secret and he thought “if 2 pumps of oil is better than 1 then 6 must be amazing” we received so many complaints over his oily popcorn had to throw the whole batch out in giant garbage bags the lesson a little oil goes a long way don’t overdo it with that stuff ,positive
the juxtaposition between angel and leos reactions is hilarious leo the juices themselves you get from the steak are creamier its a little bit more savory its a little bit rich whatever you did to it enhanced the flavors of the steak and made it an overall better experience i love this angel the second one had a urgh you know like its like urgh its like urgh you know its like uurrgh,positive
a thought hit me recently we need a guga meatloaf i can just imagine how amazing that would be whether with waygu or regular beef i think it would be an awesome experiment,positive

in ww2 when the americans liberated the concentration camp saintcyprien located in france the american troops wanted to feed the newly freed camp prisoners because they have been starving without knowing what would happen if they would feed them heavy food literally seconds after liberating them the soldiers thinking it was the right thing started giving the prisoners apples sandwiches and even chocolates leading to a lot of prisoners dying after that incident the science team gave out an order to not feed the prisoners in the camps and to let the medical staff feed them first it was mostly a slow input of light soup,negative
the fact that jimmy talked about refeeding syndrome and had a bunch of medical experts on standby really shows the precautions he takes behind the scenes hes really serious about doing these challenges and definitely should be taken inspiration for a lot of people,positive
there’s a story on youtube about a crew of japanese sailors who shipwrecked on an island and went a few weeks without food they were eventually rescued by an american ship and the captain was extremely strict with what the starving crew ate making sure they only ate small amounts of soup ship captains in the 1800’s clearly knew how to deal with starvation and it goes to show how easily knowledge can be lost,negative
one could say gordans food is to die for,negative
my grandmother told me this story were from the philippines and during the end of wwii during and at the exit of the japanese occupation the us military started to air drop supplies to the civilians including food one of my grandmothers neighbors a young boy picked up a can of corned beef and ate it straight from opening the box of supplies he dropped dead moments after at the time my grandmother thought he died from choking to death but later realized it must have been refeeding syndrome,negative
i just feel the need to say as someone diagnosed with anorexia nervosa i appreciate you mat for bringing light to the dangers and science of them,positive
slight correction pretty sure gordan didnt know mrbeast was fasting until he literally started cooking for him he probably would not have even started cooking if he knew by the time he started he definitely has the pride of a chef to have his target audience enjoy his food,neutral
1315 just a quick correction there jimmy did do it for the content but he stated in the comments it was also because he has crohns disease which means he has a nasty amount of gut inflammation he wanted to know if fasting would help with the inflammation,negative
i was in a pretty bad accident when i was younger spent about 3 weeks in icu hooked up to a nutrients iv and could only drink water with a straw while stuck in bed i still remember the first time i tried to eat solid food after that it was a little microwave kraft dinner cup i took one bite and immediately was hit with a wave of nausea to the point and nearly vomited right there in my hospital bed i havent really been able to eat plain kd since then,negative
this is probably my favourite food theory video to date this information could save lives of people who fast whether voluntarily or not as someone who has unfortunately been in a position of not being able to acquire food i really appreciate this information there had been times in which i went a few days without food only to try and stuff myself i only ever felt sick and knowing its my bodys natural response is a huge perspective change,positive

looks great the bakery where i work makes blueberry cornmeal muffins for dairy we use sour cream rather than milkbuttermilk and we also add a little lemon zest and vanilla but otherwise very similar someone has maybe already commented this but we also toss the blueberries with one reserved cup for a recipe of this size probably a couple teaspoons or a tablespoon would be perfect of the dry ingredients before mixing them in to keep them from sinking blueberries and cornmeal make a great combo,positive
you can try coating the berries with flour before you mix them in the flour coating on them slows down how fast they fall to the bottom of the pan the same goes for things like chocolate chips,neutral
its a common trick in a lot of baking circles to toss the fresh fruit with a little bit of flour before stirring in the fruit to your baked item so for a pound of blueberries perhaps toss them together with about two tablespoons of flour which should keep them suspended in the batter as it bakes,neutral
i’m upset about other things in my life and i’m still confident that i would love these and not complain about blueberry placement,positive
perfect timing we have two blueberry bushes that give us about 2 gallons of blueberries every summer tomorrow the picking begins and will continue for at least two weeks cant wait to try this recipe,positive
this looks so delicious cant wait to try it,positive
ive heard a good way to keep berries from sinking is to coat lightly in flour before adding them into the batter,positive
i call the sweet style cornbread breakfast cornbread cause when its paired with a glass of milk or cup of coffee it makes a great breakfast im gonna try adding blueberries to my next batch,positive
looks delicious ive got a recipe for strawberry cornmeal cake and i add the strawberries last and gently swirl them into the batter thats already in the pan to keep them suspended incake that being said i also love cobbler so i dont have a problem with blue bottom cornbread either,positive
im really impressed by how clean your oven looks and of course your blueberry cornbread which looks heavenly cant wait to try this recipe,positive

when my youngest sister was about a month or so away from having her first child i told her that the hospital takes the placenta and will make something like spaghetti or lasagna and thats the first meal after her baby was born she kinda freaked out when they brought her a bowl of spaghetti im such a mean brother ,negative
nothing sonny tries shocks me anymore lol i mean drinking raw blood and eating a fish alive great content as usual,positive
its really interesting that you said that placentas texture is very mushroomlike because theres a really good manga that featured evil babies that grew out their placentas into fake mushrooms so they could mind control the hospital staff by feeding them the placentashrooms makes you wonder if junji ito ate placenta before,positive
in my hometown in việt nam when i was a child we raised cows and we also ate placenta it was not an everyday treat and in my opinion it is a delicious delicacy so fascinating to see some thai folks enjoy it as well,positive
with the combination of animals organs countries and styles of cooking i love how sonny would never run out of content like this ,positive

i never thought id type this sentence but as someone with a fear of snakes id actually try the snake intestine noodle dish this was really interesting thank you as always for the great content and calvin is awesome,positive
i just love how sonny and calvin are just having a casual food conversation after the snake went and did its business all over sonnys shirt,positive
i love calvin as a cohost i dont think hes done an episode with sonny without using the word gelatinous,positive

i can’t even express or explain how legendary and outstanding the voice actor for thorfinn was in this episode that scream holy shit reminded me of erens screams in attack on titan definitely one of my favorite moments of anime so far it’s literally his origin story now i’m wondering if askeladd really wanted thors to be the leader was that laugh a change within the moment i’m not sure but wow what an episode  full uncut reaction to this reaction every reaction i upload on my patreon ,positive
the sad part is when askellad asked thors to be their leader he was actually serious but as he realized it was impossible he had to laugh it off to save face in front of his men,negative
this show is about to pick up and you’re gonna love these characters more and more as it goes nick,positive
thorfinn screaming his lungs out saying he’s going to kill them gives me the biggest chills because you can hear all the pain in his voice but at the same time you can hear how serious he is  i can’t want to see how he will accomplish this ,negative

nick how about you guys all attack him at once archers on the cliffs so anyway we started blasting,neutral

we brought you into this world nope my mother did and i respect her for this but i refuse to respect someone based on their gender or race or anything else other than your behaviour and character,negative
speaking only from my experience as a 40 year old man most of the guys i knew in highschool are all still friends pretty much all the girls hate each other two women will stare daggers at each other because the other one wore the same color as her two guys can get into a fist fight and if the right song comes on the jukebox they become best friends and spend the rest of the night drinking and talking about music,negative
i know your joking but you couldnt produce us without us guys planting the seed thanks for being real,neutral
i am grateful for the woman that brought me into this world not only that she loved me and supported me in ways no one would she went above and beyond while others have been one disappointment after another i owe her everything and i help her out whenever she asked but the thing is only one woman brought me into this world and that credit does not roll over to the rest of the gender,positive
okay this gonna be a long one sorry about that im french and theres an interesting fact about france its that we are brutally honest most other people dont like that so we are called arrogant rude obnoxious but we are not we are just honest and people dont like honesty when we are considered high in the list of nations where spouses cheat on each other its not because we cheat more than you its just because we honestly answered the questions youre probably wondering where im going with that well i was reading all the coments about women being mean to each other not staying friends with each other yadayadayada and i cant relate at all because it doesnt work like that here i still know a lot of female who were already friend in high school and im 40 whenever i see my mother or my girlfriend or my girl friends they are just friendly i dunno its probably only on screen but the number of time i saw in tv shows or movies a group of girls being friendly then as soon as one leave they all turn to bitch on this one thats something i never saw in france they bitch on her while she is here and she doesnt take it badly because she does the same so i was wondering why is that why are they still friends if its different for others then i realized because we are honest my female friends wont hesitate to look at each others and say wow girl you look like shit today didnt you put on weight recently maybe you should work out and for me thats a healthy relationship why does american males manage to stay friends because they trash talk each other because they are honest because they say things as they are yeah sometimes we have fallouts but we mend things why cant female american stay friends because they are sneaky they lie ooooh you look gorgeous girl you are so strong i envy you while not thinking any of that sooner or later in any relationship based on lie the truth will come out and its not going to be pretty,negative
i know that women brought us into this world but be honest if that was the case then all women would be doing exactly what their mothers wanted them to be growing up just saying all women can relate to mom guilt,neutral
it was super difficult to mashup this whole fight 5 parts searching for all the parts in the anime it was difficult but enjoyed it hope you guys would enjoy too part 1 part 2 part 3 part 4 dont forget my backup channel enjoy,positive
more than a thousand chapters and for me it is still the most dramatic luffy fight in no other have i felt that it has had to be pushed to the limit as in this one,positive
so glad usopp returned for this part of the arc tho we never got an explanation to where sogeking went,positive
definitely one of luffys toughest opponents ever seeing that luccis fighting skills were superior than his pretimeskip,positive
when i first watched this i was so hyped up i was cheering for luffy to win i felt nervous and also i felt like i was there in a way,positive
the ussop moment before the finisher really made this the best main villian finisher in the series so much better than the laido finisher,positive

this one also looks promising because the directors are same and hrithik looks fine as always also excited because the bgm is done by sam cs who is an underrated music director who composed music for the original vikram vedha will need to check the songs done by vishalshekhar who are also good music directors excited for the trailer,positive
the tamil one sethupathi gave a more calmer yet menacing version of vedha whereas hrithik here seems to be out and out brutal really eager to see how good he has been throughout the entire movie,positive
ive watched original vikram vedha tamil and honestly i just loved vijay setupathi as vedha and his mannerisms but i would love to see hrithik as vedha ,positive
gave me goosebump at the last hearing the original bgm ,positive
this got me so hyped especially hrithik being the highlight for me also the it factor for me was to see such a diverse talented cast and the bgm as well achara saying that it wasnt convincing actually makes me believe that shes just still adjusting to seeing hrithik in a negative role because those eyes stood out for me giving that maniac sadistic vibe that it was supposed to and the background setting of imambara from lucknow though,positive
the movie is based on one of the panchatantra stories of vikramraja vikramadityavedhaghost theme is where the raja is haunted by the ghost and it tells raja one story and asks questions at the end of each story and based on the answer the ghost will take action panchatantra stories are the childhood stories about morals and the directors have made a nice depiction in the movie,neutral
despite being a remake everyone is excited and going to support this film because of its outstanding starcast their performances is going to be fire  especially of hrithik he never disappoints always tries to bring something different to the audience,positive
tamil is a tremendous success may they get that success or more in hindi too looking at the casting there is hope and so are the directors the end bgm is ,positive
a lot of people are missing the reason why hrithik went in different direction to vedhas character than sethupathis calm composed vikram vedha is based on old indian folk talemythology of vikrambetaalbaital from baitalpachisi betaal is described as a creaturemonster who questions king vikramadityas strong sense of justice betaal is little bit crazy and inhuman addressing acharas concern and thats the vibe im getting from hrithiks vedhas unlike sethupathi they are going more traditional route and hrithik didnt copy amitabhs character from agneepath either honestly i like the approach original creators and hrithik took for this one,neutral
while everyone is appreciating greek godlets take a moment to appreciate saif as well this man is definition of diverse roles from playing funny goofy college guys to playing intense roles like sartaj udaybhan in tanhaji and vikram he proved that atleast one major khan in industry works in realistic cinema as well he also have maintained his physique and look at such age definitely deserves appreciation,positive
sorry about the bland background everyone we will back to our original space for episode 4 hope you guys liked our reactions ,positive
you can tell its their first romance drama ,neutral
lmao i don’t think y’all are understanding junho’s character minwoo is his roommate that is all he’s keeping whale talk with youngwoo to only lunchtime because he wants to get to know her therefore they talk about other things than whales anytime else and his reaction to her in the wedding dress was his awakening to liking her lol he’s not confused,neutral
it’s ok don’t worry about the background im glad my favourite youtubers are doing their reaction ,positive
the brides father in this is in a ton of dramas hes really good at playing harsh grandfather or ceo types usually if hes in a drama i watch it,positive
junho and minwoo are roommates thats why you saw him in the mirror when junho was brushing his teeth and at the end her father kept repeating the fact that she got him sushi to point out how ironic it was that his daughter went to a highend restaurant but got him sushi which is the japanese version of gimpap which is literally what he sells and what he made her for breakfast its ironic cuz if it were anybody else who went to an expensive restaurant they would have brought back something that he usually wouldnt eat not sushi and in the car the lawyer lady told him to stop talking to young woo about whales entirely which is not what he did he didnt listen to her cuz he doesnt find it annoying the reason he set up a specific time is so she wouldnt call him while hes in the bathroom or if hes busy also you could see he was disappointed when she said she has nothing else to say to him and thats because he wants her to be curious about him but she isnt so he already likes her,neutral
im gonna become your patreon just because this show and those hats i love you guys,positive
by the way if this hasn’t commented yet all the cases in the episode happened in real life or real cases the was a lawyer who wrote essay about his cases they bought the copyright from him and hire him as their consultant as a lawyer to have the perfective of an attorney this episode focus about being independent from your parent especially going into marriage remember at the beginning young woo’s father wish that someday her daughter will get married because it all father’s dream to walk their daughter into the aisle and at the end of the episode yw said that if she will get married someday she will not throw the bouquet instead hand it to him so that he can get married since he never have a change to have one and just take care of her which is just the sweetest thought a daughter saying to a single parent so that he will not be lonely then our bride finally have the guts to be free from her father’s grasped because he is controlling her so much that she doesn’t have the say if she is arranged to be married lastly junho and min woo are friends and flatmates they are not gays anyway you will find out in the coming episodes,neutral
her dad was being sarcastic in the most compassionate way when she brought him seaweed sushi from the expensive restaurant like she had the option to bring him literally anything else from a place thats 300k per meal and she brings something similar to what he spends all day making its like bringing a sandwich shop owner a sandwich with fancier ingredients but from woo young woos perspective gimbapseaweed sushi is her favorite thing so it was a gift of love for her dad,positive
they fell in love with the lawyer with the wedding dress and that smile,positive
this movie was tricky with the amount of swearing in it youtube kept restricting it as 18 and blocked in some countriesterritories so i had to mute all the f words so that everyone can have access to the video,negative
its so cute that dasha was so happy when she was able to pronounce thriller,positive
as insane as walter is he was correct about the kidnappers being amateurs and the toe belonging to someone else,negative
the coen brothers are two of the greatest american directors i iike all of their films but as others have suggested “fargo” and “raising arizona” are essential films to see,positive
the fact that walter practically causes half the film’s problems yet it turns out in the end not to mention for all for the wrong reasons he was right about everything,negative
this film becomes much more enjoyable as you watch it several times,positive
for how overthetop walter is he is a lovable character,positive
having enjoyed two of the coen brothers movies you should probably watch a few more i think fargo is probably the one i would recommend most raising arizona o brother where art thou and true grit would probably also be on the short list for followup movies,positive
julianne moore is an excellent actress here playing an artist who wants to be a single mother,positive
this movies actually a play on the 1940s film noir style of filmmaking movies like the maltese falcon the big sleep or later on stuff like chinatown about a jaded detective starting what seems like a simple case to pay the bills but quickly spirals into a complex web of competing parties where just when youve got it all figured out a new piece of info puts everything into a totally different light so basically the movie is about how a scenario like that would play out if the detective was an aging hippy with no sense of selfmotivation who is completely unqualified to deal with it at the time it came out people compared it to their previous film fargo which while it had distinctly minnesotan humor it was still a serious truecrime story in the end but comparison the big lebowski is a lot sillier and plays around a lot more with genre while ultimately having a story thats about nothing and people didnt like it it became whats known as a cult classic after it came out on home video when all the couch potatoes gave it a second chance,neutral
true story and sad about val kilmer having throat cancer and pretty much unable to act again and tom cruise fought to have val kilmer to be in the film writing in his condition and his appearance in the film was absolutely beautiful,positive
3848 a sequel that deserves and gets a wonderful reaction from mish ellie the final half hour of this is a real emotional wringer no matter what – but it’s especially intense and all the more adrenalinfilled if like mish ellie you’ve seen the first film already,positive
in the final scene it really is tom cruise flying the plane and it really is his plane he also owns and pilots a jet,neutral
michelle its a privilege to fly with maverick ellie tell that to his dad legit spat tea choked at that one re mavs f18 being unable to fly again after his demo pulling gs damages the structure of aircraft too many gs will break the airframe immediately but even pulling less than that limit will still do damage microscopic cracks that build up over time invisibly weaking the airframe until it breaks sometimes during normal nonextreme flying to combat this all aircraft have a rated glife that is the maximum cumulative number of gs they can pull in their lives before theyre retired as a precautionary measure mavs extreme maneuvers during the demo may not have broken his f18 immediately but they may have used up so much of its glife that its effectively scrap anyway,negative
its really cool to compare the leap in cinematography when it comes to filming the action with the fighters in the 80s it was amazing but now it looks pretty calm and the shots in this movie taken from inside and outside the planes are amazing,positive
3054 the numbers on the screen that were climbing was gforce g stands for gravity 2 gs is 2x gravity 7 gs is 7x gravity etc he pulled over 10 gs which means at that one particular moment he weighed 10x his body weight the same goes for the aircraft what he was saying to maverick was that he put so much stress on the aircraft that it bent the frame itself making it unairworthy since you would have to replace everything anyway,neutral
ive been waiting for this one since you did the first im so conflicted i spent most of my life using top gun as an example that not all great movies need a sequel then the bastards made one and then they added insult to injury by making it so fucking good lol,negative
its the best action movie seen all year and its understandable why tom cruise went out of his way to get this movie seen in theaters that feeling of watching a movie and feeling all the adrenaline was almost gone good reaction girls,positive
ellie loves goose a lot few times goose was shown through flashbacks or mentioned she was emotional,positive
one of the best movies ive ever seen honestly i wasnt even a big fan of the first top gun so i had no expectations with this one but it blew me away,positive
y’all know that jr and kane clip made my day,positive
kane had some of the best returns in his career the pops that he got were ridiculously unreal they shouldve given kane more world championships than they did,positive

my 1 would have been cena returning at mitb last year hearing cole sound like joey styles when cena came out was hilarious,positive
sting returning at wm 31 and rock returning at 2012 on raw was litrerly the loudest pop and commentators were absolutely going wild,positive
we all know john cena’s return from this year should’ve been on there,neutral
matt smith portrayal of daemon targaryen was nothing short of perfection he plays the character the way i imagined he would be in a live action format cant wait for yah to see more of him also ladies this show is about the dance of dragons so yah wont be seeing the mad king in this show,positive
matt smith is another example of dont judge a casting until you see them in the role because i was like bruh they got dr who to play one of the most badass characters in the history of westeros then i saw this episode and was highly impressed,positive
i liked that they showed daemon crying at the funeral they took great effort to show how antagonistic he is but then showed us he clearly loves his family,positive

2430 to answer you ladies my sister was a military nurse and in her studies the first cesarean goes way back to switzerland in the 1500s and believed to be the way julius cesar was born hence the name then the first one came to the us in the 1700s but they were brutal and often resulted in death for both mother and child and a last ditch effort until 1794 jesse bennett dedicated himself to perfect it and his students made the practice normal all over the world and by 1938 csections were normal and a way of life,neutral

my theory here that plant creature could possibly be that fungus but in a more mutated form as seen previously in the missing persons and autopsy report videos whenever someone dies in the backrooms they get covered in this black coloured fungus this fungus is said to be growing and feeding itself onto the person it has attached itself onto mutating itself onto the dead body given that how it takes a long time for certain funguses to mutate 100 1000 or even millions of years at best and also given that how time passes strangely in the backrooms as seen by the researcher who was in the informational video with the date 291990 looked as if he teleported when that strange bizarre flash appeared and his other group researchers vanished however it wasnt teleportation but instead time travel that researcher was all of a sudden sent to the future a couple of months ahead as it was shown in the presentation video with the date 581990 when the alarm rang out and cctv footage showing us the same researcher guy who by some miracle made it back to the entry gate point artificially created by async so by this logic the whenever someone dies in the backrooms the fungus on the dead body has already reached the mutation stage in a short amount of time the creature in this found footage has to be the driver who died in the car crash as seen in kanes secret video of 9780415263573 this car travelling at a really high speed on a highway suddenly no clipped through the road and due to the high speed the driver wasnt able to push the brakes in time to stop the car thus it crashed into the wall as seen in the footage the driver who was still alive at the time but badly injured seemed to have crawled his way to the room where this teenage girl encountered the creature and possibly bled to death there the fungus grew on him and later the entire room in its mutated form also it sounded like the creature was yelling out help in a distorted sound possible the last words of the driver before his death in that room which was seen in the original found footage video and later the pitfalls video that this creature seems to mimic the sounds of its last victims and in this case even its originator which is the driver its all just a theory which i just came up with dont take it canon lol,negative
speaking about backrooms you definitely should check out the complex found footage free game on steam its heavily inspired by kane pixels version and nails the vibe,positive
i have a theory for that green cracking in the walls if you look closely at the entrance she came from it widens so i think that the backrooms was making a new nest for the entity but since the rooms entrance got so wide the entity was given a chance to capture her also you hear its roar before it cuts editjust figured out that human blood causes the bacteria on bodies to grow so the green lighting is definitely something else,neutral
kane has proven without a doubt that he truly has serious talent when it comes to storytelling and world building i can’t wait to see what he has in store for us later down the line glad to see you’re still keeping up with the series ryan,positive
lucky that steel energy card wasnt very old some collectors would be having a mental breakdown if it was also love to see u got pokemon cards too and love to see more backrooms content,positive
the humor and jokes of ryan is just top tier easily one of the best comedic gaming youtubers,positive
theory for the green lightning at the walls in the end the lightning looks very similar to the vines where the entity was nesting so to theorize the backrooms creates nests for those who are about to die as you can hear the entity getting closer and closer as the green lightning generates,neutral
if im thinking correctly ever since they opened the backrooms random holes have been appearing around the world this kid and the car driver happend to stumble upon them,neutral

no sequel to a movie that is over 30 years old should be this damn spectacular i saw this opening night in imax and it was one of the absolute best moviegoing experiences of my life the sound of the jets flying by the literal feeling of the vibrations in your seat when the g forces kick in and especially the visuals of seeing everything from the point of view of the pilots i legitimately believed during the final dogfight that maverick was going to die so few movies today make me believe that on top of all that the story is so freaking amazing the theme of showing how fighter pilots are still needed even in the age of drones the story of rooster learning to not just forgive maverick but to let go of being so overly careful in his flying and “don’t think just fly” and of course the most emotionally powerful if the movie when maverick visits iceman even though he has retired due to his throat cancer and has difficulty speaking he still managed to give an absolutely heartbreaking performance thank you tom cruise for fighting so hard to get this movie in theaters,positive
tom cruise is truly the embodiment of megastardom one of the best films in decades,positive
i love how hangman could’ve been a typical cliche bad guy and he absolutely isn’t he’s cocky and arrogant in top gun because that’s what top gun brings out of young pilots their competitive nature once he’s on the aircraft carrier he is all business encouraging and ready to help i love that,positive
sad that val kilmer iceman has been dealing with throat cancer these last few years you saw him in willow but its beautiful how they wrote his illness into the story and gave his character weight and honor he also played batman once ,positive
spiderman no way home and top gun maverick both brought back the moviegoing experience in huge droves as both films became one of the first films to gross over 1 billion worldwide at the box office since the pandemic began also tom cruise and paramount made the right decision delaying this for two years because its a film thats made for the big screen and everyone knows that,positive
mags if you remember from the beginning of the first film penny benjamin was mentioned briefly as one of the reasons why maverick got disciplined several times,neutral
1545 val kilmer lost his voice for real due to throat cancer but they used an ai computer program to digitally recreate his voice it was nice to see them bring him onboard for this movie heartwarming and one of the most amazing moments in the film all because tom wanted him to be a part of this movie so much i got to meet val kilmer at a convention a few years ago after he beat cancer but lost his voice he was one the bravest and kindest guys ever,positive
i used to own a betamax similar to vhs tape of top gun many years ago and me and my 2 kids aged 5 and 4 would watch it almost daily now theyre grown up and have their own family and yet we got to watch maverick together at home here in the philippines it was an absolutely amazing sequel and yes we all felt the stress and emotions just as you did magy your reactions were so on point and wonderful to watch thank you,positive
im with you magy i loved this movie and felt it was actually better than the first,positive
fun fact the reason why the f35 fighter that maverick mentions when hes briefed on the target is not the ideal candidate for the mission is because of the gps jamming in actuality behind the scenes the f35 didnt have room in the cockpit for the cameras that they outfitted in the f18s they needed to have the actors ride backseat with real pilots in order to film the flight sequences and the f35 couldnt accommodate that,negative

the genuine disgust everyone had at otto telling alicent to go to the king and give him comfort while wearing one of her mothers dresses is everything i think daemon is going to be a standout character thanks to matt smiths nuance portrayal of him i loved smiths delivery and daemons blunt acknowledgement of the truths viserys cant bear to face as ever thank you so much for sharing your reactions looking forward to the season to come,positive

such a good feeling seeing you guys back at the bar watching game of thrones this just feels right,positive
targaryans have prophetic dreams called dragon dreams however as maester aemon said i see them in my dreams sam i see a red star bleeding in the sky i still remember red i see their shadows on the snow hear the crack of leathern wings feel their hot breath my brothers dreamed of dragons too and their dreams killed them every one the grief and glory of house targaryen,negative
daemon is being made a lot more nuanced than he was in fire and blood the “heir for a day” brothel scene really makes me question him we saw that he’s not enjoying himself at all despite frequenting brothels before and renting this one out specifically to celebrate the gold cloaks’ accomplishments with the boys mysaria seems to be an enabling force goading him into his darker tendencies when he says “we must all grieve in our own ways” i think he actually was somewhat saddened by baelon’s and aemma’s death daemon does want power but he does love his brother “over the centuries house targaryen has produced both great men and monsters prince daemon was both in his day there was not a man so admired so beloved and so reviled in all westeros he was made of light and darkness in equal parts to some he was a hero to others the blackest of villains” archmaester gyldayn,negative
absolutely in love with this new show already loved all the actors and rhaenyras dracarys was absolutely amazing,positive
important to note there’s 10 adult dragons under targ control but there’s also unhatched and juvenile dragons and also some wild dragons just chilling on dragon stone so in total there should be around 17 alive in this period,neutral
that childbirth scene was gruesome the screams affected me just as much as shireen’s burning at the stake,negative
house of the dragon is inspired by georges book called fire and blood which tells the story of what was known as one of the most violent wars and power struggles within the game of thrones universe the tragic fight was called the dance of dragons and this event takes place 100 years before daenerys the funny thing about the book is that it is a kind of book within the universe itself thats because the dance of dragons was a historical event and when reading the book as it is written the impression one gets is that any inhabitant of westeros could go to the library and read the same book telling about what led to the dance of the dragons to happen and yes it was just a book that tells about this event and it is already finished so for the series we can expect less seasons than got and a more complete story different from the ending of got that was not written by george since the books still are not finished but all the characters of house of the dragon were created by him as well as the basis of the story although some things can and will have some changes hope i helpedxx,neutral
targaryans have a history of putting a lot of stock in their dreams the only reasons the house survived the doom of valyria is because one of them had a dream it would happen and they packed up and went to dragonstone even in game of thrones dany had a dream about stepping into the fire that hatched her eggs thats why she did it this is the problem with watching this show and criticizing certain characters without having any book context at all,negative
why is it always in breech breech is 34 and rises sharply with multiple births like the queen has its not common but it rises to between 1 in 20 to 1 in 10,neutral
my underestanding is that the wife wasnt going to survive either way so it was a matter of letting the gods take them both or actively killing his wife to save the baby an absolutely terribly choice especially given how she would have to go through it weve seen some horrible stuff but her death scene was up there with one of ramsays scenes i also think given recent political events in the us it was very timely without being an overt political statement like we might see from marvel not to mention it was the pivotal moment that sets the stage for everything to come also i hear this series will be far more morally grey than game of thrones ever was daemon gives me ramsay or joffrey vibes but hell be much more complex and less villainous while he seems to operate on selfmotivation his violence isnt wanton or random like joffrey or ramsay so i picture him being closer to a cerseijaime style character but if anything he absolutely gives peak targaryen vibes and matt smith gives a stellar performance im really excited to see corlys valaryon and rhaenys targaryen a shame we havent seen much of rhaenys but i picture her having some of cerseis chip on her shoulder for being snubbed the crown i hate to touch on this but i know corlyss racial change was of concern and i originally had slight concern myself not because some omg woke bs but because of the velaryons and the targaryens are supposed to be basically siblings in relation so i prefer representation coming from a new source rather than an existing one but if you think about it the light complexion of the targaryens is much more of an oddity given their geographic origins furthermore valyria was awfully close to the summer isles and sothoryos so to me corlys is more what i would envision the original valyrians would look like so it doesnt bother me in the slightest especially after seeing him on screen he seems like a great character already and i think and hope hes up there with davos otto hightower gives strong tywin and littlefinger vibes prioritizing family image and political opportunity above all he does seem like a type of manofhonor but more in the sense of being a strict rulefollower stuck in the old ways and then obviously viserys is the ned stark of the series i love seeing that name reclaimed and while the timing was bad and perhaps more of necessity im glad he apologized to rhaenerys and shows a lot of faith in her i especially like that when brought up with the council the first response was theres never been a queen but one of the others was quick to chime in with only out of precedent and tradition its nice to see them consider it rather than the whole group quickly dismissing it has hah but shes a woman maybe rhaenys serves as a reminder of what they could have had also while the age difference between him and alicent is a little insane and i dont like otto pimping out his daughter like that i do think they would legitimately treat each other well probably erring on the side of viserys being distant with her because he misses his wife and is traumatized by her passing and the part he played in it most of all the show felt like we jumped straight into s3 or s4 of game of thrones,negative

this avemaria composed by igor krutoy sang by dimash as you see this song is amazing ,positive
the composer of this is the piano player igor krutoy he came out of semiretirement to work with dimash he has composed for people like lara fabian and andrea bocelli  igor wrote a post about this song on his ig one evening about three months before the new wave dimash called me and asked if i could write ave maria for him explaining that he wanted to sing something in that style coincidentally i had a free evening and i gladly sat down at the piano and remembering the italian formula of responsibility worked with inspiration until i achieved the desired result after taking a few days for the composition to rest in my ears soul and heart i sent it to dimash who literally within half an hour answered that it was exactly what he wanted to hear and of course the reception and applause given to dimash by the audience at the new wave show what a happiness it is to do what i love to write for such a genius singer to evoke deep emotion in the audience and to be in demand just a short essay on what is happiness,positive
me dio risa cuando estaban hablando y riéndose antes de que dimash abriera la boca y emitiera el primer sonido se quedaron mudos esta es la capacidad que tiene dimash de cautivar al público sin decir una sola palabra es maravilloso esta es una composición de igor krutoy especialmente para dimash no tiene letra para que las personas de cualquier credo puedan disfrutarla y vaya que lo logra gracias por su sincera admiración al magnifico dimash ,positive
this vocalise of ave maria was composed by igor krutoy especially for dimash it goes without saying that this newest version of the traditional songs is almost beyond belief in its simplicity and power nobody can pull off a vocalise as well as dimash the greatest vocalist i have ever heard in my 80 years on this planet and ive heard some really great singers along the way and in every genre ever conceived what a blessing to experience this voice this incomparable talent btw very nice reaction,positive

hes not younger this was 2021 hes was 27 at the time same as stranger and fly away this is an original composed version of ave maria by igor krutoy per dimashs request it does share some similarities with the caccini composition and might have been the inspiration some have posited that because igor is jewish and dimash is muslim they may have opted to forego the lyrics for this reason which would make sense again i dont believe that has been confirmed by either one,neutral

i would really like to see a sequel to the movie with keanu reeves coming back as the titular character and guillermo del toro directing this was back in 20182019 but with their busy schedules looks like we might have to wait a little while longer,positive
yay this movie is underrated imo so glad you’re seeing it i’m sad keanu couldn’t get it rolling as a franchise,positive
cool little detail you might have missed is that at the beginning when that guy finds the spear of destiny and then turns and looks over his shoulder at seemingly nothing it was because he sensed constatine was behind him later on in the movie when constatine uses that electric chair to track down where the spear is it shows him standing behind the guy when he finds the spear so its like a little time travel thing,neutral
this was a great movie on its own and wouldve been great as a standalone series shame it didnt get a sequel but i like it as it is as well i know some people dont like it because of it not reflecting the comics character as much but i say it was a very good version of it,positive
i really like tilda swinton in this movie and even though a lot of people didn’t like it when it came out i did i’m glad you’re watching it now greg good stuff,positive

ive just recently watched the original but ive to say that this teaser actually looks really good im not going to compare it to the original as original will always be original but ive high hopes from this film because its the same duo who directed the original one personally i dont have any problems from a remake and i dont think remaking something is a crime the remake however has to be good if it doesnt justify the acting of the original actors then its a crime otherwise if its a remake like kabir singh which is a really good remake then i dont have any problems and i feel this remake will be genuinely good,positive

i have watched vikram vedha on youtube in hindi last year i dont think saif can beat r madhwan in acting r madhwan surprised us in the end as he looks innocent throughout the whole movie but saif doesnt look innocent at all throughout the trailer r madhwans smile was enough to make vikram vedha a thriller movie,positive

krk reviews should be released in theatres all reviews one after another for 3 hours it will become blockbuster ,positive
sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25 crores for a movie even highly educated proffesionals cas engineers doctors civil servants etc do not earn this kind of money in india after 10 year of service a simple logic if theses actors including the kumars khans devgans kapoors roshans etc start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price these superstars have built their mansions worth 100 crores and secured the lifes of their children and grandchildren they are living kingsize life with our hard earned money i believe we better stick to ott or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on youtube or any other app,negative

hey krk you are someone who is an well educated well sensed human who is trying to destroy the good works for his own personal interest everyone can agree that the recent vikram vedha teaser is really well stucked piece of art yeah its a remake but why it has made because the original one was not popular at all and it holds a great contents so why not it should be showcased second time hrithik roshan is someone who thrives himself towards great art work so guys dont take seriously these kind of nonsense review by a nonsense person like krk ,neutral

so happy y’all are reacting to hotd i found you two through the arcane reactions and i’m so excited to watch you watch yet another hopefully amazing series ,positive
it is true that we didnt hear daemon said the heir for a day and his account might be true after all when he said we each mourn our own ways we are only told via ottos report and we know they despised each other the labeling could be interpreted in either good or bad way just like the title the queen who never was could be considered a mockery but also it could mean you acknowledge that she should be the queen maybe daemon is indeed honoring his dead nephew one thing is for sure though i think his love for his brother is genuine however rogue his ways are he knows his brother is weak and he sees otto hightower for what he is he really wanted to protect his brother from crows thats waiting for a feast hes definitely going to be a grey character and they tend to be the most interesting,neutral
1932 thats what you got from daemons smile how are everyone giving daemon villain tag so quickly it feels like i saw some other episode and many other people saw another it felt more like my brother knows me hes right these other idiots know nothing smile daemon is vicious and acts douchy but also cares about his family from the scenes before with rhaenyra at the funeral,negative
i actually loved daemon he seems to actually love his family as soon as the king said why would i do that about not making him his handdaemons immediate answer was cause i’m your brotherit didn’t sound like it was a birth right thing but that he was actually hurt his brother didn’t choose him and he’s for sure not wrong the console is playing him they see his weakness and you can afford to show weakness as a leader it’s a fact,positive
so excited you guys are reacting to this can’t wait to start this journey with you both ,positive
i think everyone just antogonising daemon but personally i dont think hes bad guy hes just an extreme person and soon enough they will notice how necessary he was nblike this comment if you think so too cause i have a gut feeling by the end of this season or maybe next people will understand him eren yager effect,neutral
after the foul taste the original got left in my mouth i didnt have very high hopes for this yet i watched it and it honestly feels like the earlier seasons maybe not quite there yet but definitely enough to have me hooked and wanting more of it i find it hard to pinpoint daemon on the one hand he wants to show strength the city watch part but then hes also arrogant the tournament claiming victory while the fight wasnt over and straight up horrible heir for a day but on the other hand he really cares for rhaenyra and at the funeral he told her her father would need him more now than ever before which shows he also cares for viserys i think him calling viserys weak was his blunt way of telling viserys to watch out for those at the council and act like a king which is in line with what he did with the city watch he feels like the king should show his strength viserys seems like hes held things together for those 9 years but this clearly is coming to an end i feel like hes made a huge mistake by alienating daemon this wont make things easy for rhaenyra who already has to fight the fact that some people dont want a woman on the throne in the end i think it will be between those two and viserys will be long gone from the picture,negative
they referenced the white walker prophecy at the end when the king was talking to his daughter seems it’s a warning passed from king to king little did they know it took 172 years to come to pass and the king even says a targaryen has to be on the throne to win that cold war yes it’s rumored the throne rejects those who aren’t worthy by cutting them this whole series will show us how such a powerful family like the targaryen’s become the died off long lost house we see in season 1 of got when daenerys was with her brother cast out and ridiculed so we’re gonna see what they did to themselves to become that so low and from 10 dragons on total around in this series to dragons no longer even exist in got and are old rumors each targaryen pairs with a dragon either a new one or one passes down from a deceased relative there are young and old dragons dragon eggs trainers and keepers so cool,neutral
pretty sure that daemon didnt actually say the heir for a day even in the books its implied that otto might have made it up to drive a wedge between the brothers and daemon just didnt want to say anything at that moment he is vile but he has his brothers best intentions in mind for sure,negative

content that you and thugesh create are real fun and respectful also without crossing the limits of roasting be consistent always thats your key,positive
going through the video after watching the live session that lakshya did before this video made me realise his unshined talent that had yet to come to light in acting the difference is his pitch language body language taking thing like i will file a case for granted really shows his supremacy and how much of an alpha he is it really reminds me of the aparichit the person who was in his youtube video and the person who was in his in his live almost feel like they were two different individuals i dont support anyone of them prince and his wife had milked there child and they not tackled any of the allegation he was just taking out his anger making personal comments but i cant just blind eye on things that lakshya said just because im his subscriber and this had cleared that the past allegation like ganging up bulling were some how true lakshya portraying an image of the person that he is not thinking we should not abuse in youtube because its an public platform and spread hate but can make an abusive live video on insta i guess insta is not a public platform anymore and its strike one thing that lakshay is not abuse because of the problem that he had faced in his past for making that kind of content,neutral
lets w a moment to to appreciate how much effort he puts into his contact to entertain,positive
the best part about the teaser is that both hrithik and saif look drastically different from r madhavan and vijay sethupathi and very honestly hrithiks vedha is looking slightly more menacing than vijays im cautious but highly excited at the same time im quite hopeful towards this movie coz the directors of the original have made this as well and if im not wrong theyve said it isnt a scene to scene remake hopefully optimistic ,positive
i’m from chennai but i’m a big fan of hrithik and don’t tell me it’s a remake it’s a beautiful script which is worth to be filmed again  and i’m glad hrithik is doing the villain role,positive
i respect to everyone who wear involved in seriously the best piece that ve every seen on youtube hats off to well all i love your video ,positive
hrithik is next level no one can beat him  he not copy vijay setupati he played his character in own swag  the king of indian cinema hr ,positive

pj never dissapoints while saying maine original movie nahi dekhi ,neutral
chalo mai bhi likh deta hu pj never disappoints  btw sach mein nhi karta ye banda disappoint ,neutral
you should watch the original movie featuring r madhavan and vijay sethupati its a masterpiece ,positive
first time after a long time after kabir singh this look promising i watched original i dont want to know about story line i just want to see the maniac and dense acting of these two,positive
its directed by original director so hell yeah im gonna watch it,positive
i love the original tamil movie the tamil version solidified vijay sethupathy as my favorite actor the whole concept of setting up the story in the vikram vetal backdrop was so unique the climax fight vedha has a come what may unhinged chaotic attitude and the crazy banter between vikram and vedha during the fight it was absolutely fresh to look at personally i love both saif and hrithik i really dont want to compare vjs and hrithik ill be honest i was skeptical about the remake but the teaser does look promising i love hrithiks attempt at being the unhinged vedha except for the accent as you rightly pointed out the teaser does look promising even though the bgm is very good i was just hearing the bgm from the original in my head i do miss it i really really really hope and pray this movie does well,positive
theres this eccentricity in hrithiks eyes that tells me hell do full justice to this role he has his own unique style and wont be just mimicking vijay sethupathy i have faith in this movie because of the makers really looking forward to it people just have to approach it with an open mind rather than being so negative even before the release,positive
the only thing thats exciting me in this film is hrithiks portrayal of a gray shaded character hrithik roshan mostly cuz the guy is just so good but in these kind of roles it always just fascinates me to watch one of my favorite actors to perform,positive
that sam cs bgm towards the end gave me massive goosebumps vishalshekar and sam are gonna kill with the soundtrack,positive
the only thing that matters is box office hrithiks agneepath was a box office hit and his vijay is totally different from amitabhs vijay if he can succeed in making a new vijay then i dont know why people are saying cant match vijay sethupati all that matters is box office rest people will always criticize no matter if its actually great,neutral
initially when i heard that hrithik roshan is playing role of veda i doubted if he could fit into that role which vijay sethu pathi immortalized that characterafter watching the teaser i am surprised and excited to see veda in this remake version congratulations to both heroes hrithik roshan and ofcourse vikram role is tailor made for saif ali khan,positive
fully agree with you regarding that scene where vedha hrithik is smiling devilishly while spraying bullets people have the habit of complaining and most of the people who are complaining they have not even watched the original vv and yes hrithik did not copy amitabh and similarly here he did not copy the great vs,negative
in orginal movie and trailer specifically both vikram and vedha were projected to be equals given equal screen time dialogues and actions but here i believe hrithik is being pushed more than saif and thats what bugs me,negative
ive just recently watched the original but ive to say that this teaser actually looks really good im not going to compare it to the original as original will always be original but ive high hopes from this film because its the same duo who directed the original one personally i dont have any problems from a remake and i dont think remaking something is a crime the remake however has to be good if it doesnt justify the acting of the original actors then its a crime otherwise if its a remake like kabir singh which is a really good remake then i dont have any problems and i feel this remake will be genuinely good,positive
i like how they made hrithik a bit devilish instead of vedha being the calm guy like in the original i feel like vjss vedha is how mohanlal wouldve played vedha and hrithiks version is how mammootty wouldve played the role,neutral

i was so excited when you announced that the watchers of the bar were returning for house of the dragon im thrilled that the first reaction episode is already out its been so long since we got to see you guys all together again thank you for bringing this back much love from oregon 3,positive
it brings me tremendous joy to see everyone back and this still a thing to us on youtube this is like a reaction reunion thanks for doing this again sean ,positive
i basically watched all of got by myself none of my real life friends cared for the show so i turned to youtube reactions and somehow you guys became my got friends people who i could relate too after each episode thank you for getting the gang back together ,positive
after having a whole pandemic between the ending of got and the beginning of hotd its really wonderful to the see the bar crew having a great time all together in one place,positive

finally i already missed you so the next one is as soon as possible jungkook and jimin are the ones who get hurt the most they always give more than they expect and often get hard on themselves and often exhaustion and fainting just for everyone to see the best of them in every performance it hurts armys to see him this way,negative
jungkook and jimin are definitely the ones who push themselves the hardest during performances they are both the ones i noticed who are getting injured or almost passing out and its sad because when their own stage they seem so lively and full of energy and then these documentaries come out and you realize when they went back stage they were suffering jungkook has gotten injured multiple times hes almost fainted a lot of times there was this one award show they went to and jungkooks hands were literally shaking and he fainted multiple times or came close to it i of course worry about all the members but i always worry the most for jimin jk because we know how much they would put a performance and entertaining army above their health sometimes,negative
guysill ask again but may you please continue and go back to the bonus content and deleted scenes you missed id really like to see you to react to them as they are important parts of bangtans world and connected to bangtans history shows how their emotions developed and changed over time and give further context to a specific era episode of the rise of bangtan i hope you dont just brush them aside as its really good imfomation to note as well as has all those behind the scenes you always like not sure why that changed but i hope youll quickly return to them before it gets too far off its a helpful smooth transition between episodes as well because it gives you a mental break and as i said really just gives you more and more context and content as the series goes on theyll be more and more important to the series too whether thats answering questions you may have had during the episode or clarifying something that couldnt be further explored in the episode itself youve already missed so much content at the very least its be nice to have a reason why you stopped all of a sudden when its importance hasnt diminished but increased every episode,positive
becoming army truly is a lifechanging experience and one that anyone who hasnt done any of the work to look back at their history and discography can never understand i would have never thought that at the age of 54 i would become such a huge fan and supporter of the boyband my daughter had been a fan of for three years already at that point 2 years later almost to the day and i look back and shake my head in wonder at how much of an impact that 7 young men only slightly older than my daughter have had on me because they have been utterly unwilling to listen to me or delve into the group themselves they have zero understanding and they all think im crazy i think all i can think is how sad it is that they wont give them a chance and experience the same thing i have i like the reactors who become true fans and are open to the life change that happens when they open their minds and hearts to the beauty that is bts you guys are that kind of reactor and its wonderful to see,positive
guys is there a chapter 22 or it ended at 21 jungkook is really hard working and perfectionist he want to go on stage matter what happens to him he is turning 25 very soon  he grew up ,positive
remember all the deleted and bonus episodes a chapter is not actually over until you watch them maybe you didn’t know i really like to watch you react to rise of bangtan but it’s beginning to seem a bit weird to me that you don’t finish a chapter until moving on your reactions always seems genuine but it has made me question wether you actually want to continue this series it’s fair id you don’t this is just so weird sorry,negative
cant wait for episode 14 the rise of bangtan chapter 14 filter,positive
to anybody whos reading this i pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better may the dark thoughts the overthinking and the doubt exit your mind may clarity replace confusion may peace and calmness fill your life ,positive

imagine this you wake up in a room that youve never seen before the bed youre lying in is very comfortable you sink right into it you dont want to leave but you want to know where you are you sit up and looking around the room you see that it looks like youre in a very cozy but very old room this room has seen many many things it seems theres a mirror to use in case the person staying in the room would like to fix themselves up to look nice there is a closet full of clothes however you see that there is already an outfit laid out for you if you prefer the feminine choice it is a beautiful seafoam green dress with a black and white striped bow and reaches just below your knees grouped with black mary janes and long white socks the masculine option is a suit that consists of the same colors in the most similar areas with black dress shoes you put on the outfit of choice and you leave the room you go down the stairs of the house to find two people they look like blonde twins one is a boy the other is a girl they are sipping their tea when one of them notices you oh youre awake the boy cries so they are the girl replies they introduce themselves as aaron and anastasia aaron tells you that since youve been asleep all morning it would be good for you to go outside with them you reluctantly agree but all of your worries fly out the door when you step outside you see a field that looks like it was masterfully painted a nice mix pastel colors by the gods themselves there are mountains in the distance and you can also see a nice pond in the sky you can see the moons and even a planet or two you can even faintly see the stars there are trees by the pond and one of them has a pair of swings the three of you walk up to that tree and you spend the rest of the day playing there the twins took turns pushing you on the swing eventually night came and you went back to the house for dinner anastasia made the most delicious bread and pasta youd ever had and aaron did the dishes insisting that you relax as their guest after a little while you retired to your bedroom changed into the clothes given to you and succumbed to a calm dreamers sleep wondering what the next day had in store for you,positive

in the animal kingdom the ability to hide disguise yourself blend in to your surroundings and be unseen not only affords you safety from predators but can also make you a deadly hunter in the african savannah zebra graze on grasses they seemingly disappear into in the madagascan jungles chameleons change the color of their skin to suit the trees they climb in the warm tropics mantis blend in amongst the foliage as they hunt their prey the octopus becomes one with the great barrier reef with apparent supernatural ability polar bears and the arctic fox disappear in the blinding snow as they scour the arctic tundra penguins play unseen by predators in antarctica and the snow leopard rules the mountains of southeast asia animal armory takes a closer look at these fantastical superpowers and the animals that wield them watch animal armory episode 4 here freedocumentary nature,neutral

i love the goose noises coming from the crow at 1301 and the horse noises for the zebras totally accurate,positive
there is a big mistake in this the dazzle camouflage doesnt work to hide the zebra in the grass its designed to make it difficult to judge distance to a target so when the lion goes to attack the zebra he might pounce too soon and when he is in the chase he will find it difficult when to strike out with his claws the same thing was used against submarines,negative

i love that as part of additional recourses for our sociology class we have these videos it is also funny how our teacher is always warning us that its focused a lot on american context d which is true because from this video it looks like usa has one of the best educational systems which is deffinetly not true here in the czech republic compulsory school attendance functions since 1774 also our entire educational system is free and there is no religon in most schools public or private of course there are many countries that have worse educational system than usa but i dont think you have the best one but its just my opinion so please dont come at me d,positive
a more cynical perspective on why public statefunded education became so popular and important for industrialized countries is because their workers now required more knowledge in order to be efficient they needed to be able to read and write and have basic numeracy skills to operate machines if the cost of teaching and training people was passed on to the state then companies would not have to spend money or time giving their workforce the tools they would be expected to use worryingly the same is happening nowadays many companies complain that people leave collegeuniversity and are not prepared to enter the workforce they want someone else to teach people to be good efficient workers so that the employer can make the most of their staff from day 1,neutral
educational institutions usually leads to an enrichment of ideas and a chance to gain an upper hand in terms of either gaining higher degrees or being more effective in your current job though there is inequality in terms of learning acquisition neighborhood preconceptions of people and income which affects how much of the education will actually be grasped by the pupil student it’s fascinating seeing how societies construct various institutions for the given populace to work around in loved the references you used as well james,positive
pleaseeee do these for uk sociological structures because most of your videos have helped my alevels so far and are incredibly helpful,positive
there needs to be more focus in school on how to think and less on what to think most kids learn how to memorize material and pass tests but only certain kids verse themselves well enough to approach extra credit problems that werent covered in class and actually require thought,neutral
we are teaching our children the wrong things in school we are creating a societal system where each section is dependent upon the other sections this means when one section fails then the rest also fail we need to teach our children to be independent instead we teach children how to be obedient workers to give meaning to someones life teach them how to grow their own food build their own house repair their own car cook their own meals eat to stay healthy and most importantly how to meditate and pray this gives life meaning,negative
interesting my learning style is slow,positive
my grade 8 science project back in the late 80s was on learning styles my teacher was shocked and surprised when i submitted my project idea all my subjects were my classmates over a span of a couple weeks i tested their comprehension of certain short stories pictures and videos through visual audio and reading when the science fair day came my booth wasnt the most popular with any of the other kids but with all the school teachers and parents they loved it i remember the results of my project was inconclusive because i tested each student individually with each individual method of learning no one method of learning is better than another but combining multiple methods of learning is where results would be seen but i ran out of time to combine methods of learning before the project was due,positive
i worked as a high school teacher for thirty years over the years it gradually dawned on me that the many educational theories which were forced on us were based on absolutely nothing but unproven theory learning style was just one of many nearly every year a new style or theory would be introduced nobody ever rigorously challenged these theories presented as facts demanding evidence and proof ever yet if you did not adapt your teaching to incorporate these unproven styles you would be judged to be a failing teacher so you had no choice at least whilst being observed i became quite cynical in the end because i realised the new methods were invented and then promoted by people just trying to further their career with something for their cv and each method would last a year or two before going out of fashion and being replaced by a new one god forbid anyone would actually just leave the teachers to use their own experience education and intelligence,negative
i had an excellent and very intense mathematical statistics professor for whom varying teaching style was his teaching style i recall one day for an hour long lecture he came in and wrote notes and provided examples and proofs and he never said a single word in another day he switched his handwriting to beautiful perfect cursive he was a bizarre teacher but pushed me to the absolute limit great prof,positive
i’ve been selfstudying alevel maths for the last two years and i think the real method to learning in my own experience is ‘repetition’ similar to how you would work out in a gym the more you do it the better you become at it i think i’ve taught myself more in the last two years than any of my teachers ever did in school,positive
im a pressure learner i only learn school material when theres severe stress and doubts about my future imposed on me,negative
people learn easier when they are interested and is enjoying to know a topic also if you understand schooling as the obligation of attend to school and have satisfying grades and education as acquire knowledge through studying for self interest it will not only be clearer that we learn only what we want to know but also that several government regulations on schools around the globe is actually making people dumber,negative
im a teacher in new zealand and vark was covered in my teaching degree 17 years ago we did questionaires to determine the order of our preferences but we were told to try and cover all these aspects in our teaching ie try and give the children a verbal aspect and an auditory aspect and a reading aspect and a kinaesthetic aspect that sounds more like the multimodal approach you described i remember i came home very excited about it and suggested to my wife that she do the questionnaire as well she looked at it and said i dont want to read all that cant you read it to me,positive
i feel like the learning styles myth has ultimately helped teaching though its encouraged teachers to be more multimodal in their teaching style in order to in their minds reach a wider variety of learners even if the hypothesis was wrong its ultimately created a stronger teaching style,positive
twenty years ago i gave a small talk about vark to my fellow educators the key point in my plenary was that learning styles are not separate but complement each other in a holistic manner over 47 years i have found many keys to assisting students to learn humour comfort having eaten slept well etc pause frequently to review points question your own knowledge openly and invite students to do the same as they learn i loved teaching and was only persuaded to finish when the paperwork before and after took more time than the educating,positive

every single one of these videos is perfectly made with amazing points everything is so well thought out these videos make the world a better place,positive
i am a teacher i love my job and i need to tell you this is happening in schools it is pushed for students to learn and understand life problems we call it the hidden curriculum it is what teachers facilitate in their classrooms teachers put students in many situations and help guide them in appropriate ways or guidance about finding themselves and their interests or understanding money which is definitely in the curriculum you are correct it is not as blatant as this example and i wish it were more but your next video i would love to see your solution to this problem the education system knows this is where we want to go they just dont know how,positive

schools definitely needs to teach the various biases and fallacies funny thing about them is that by simply knowing people will commit much less of them this is one of the purest example of knowledge is power and most certainly belongs in a curriculum,positive
great work the school of life its really heart warming that you made an effort to study the current education system and provided with a simple solution like focusing on the life challenging subjects having said that i dont want this to be just anther video i want us all to collaborate and design a real time working ed system test and work on it at small scale first then making it biggerlater because i dont want the future and the current generation to suffer the same fate as we did peace3,positive
as someone who grew up doing common core— it just took time away from learning things that were actually useful in class it frustrated the teachers attempting to teach it and it cost the school a lot of money to get all the printed math books and other common core materials for essentially no benefit to the students i can’t recall a single time common core was spoken of positively by the teachers or the other students,negative
i think we can all agree the schools need to incorporate financial education all throughout high school,neutral
so we found that the problem wasn’t the education system per se but the circumstances that children grew up in and rather than even entertain the possibility that an inequitable socioeconomic foundation was to blame it was easier to say “kids aren’t learning because there’s something wrong with the books teachers and schools” i love how simple it is to explain so many crappy circumstances through the lens of cognitive dissonance now we’ve graduated to blaming lack of homeownership on people being too indebted as opposed to a dearth of housing options in the places where people actually want to live or more accurately a dearth of places with housing where people actually want to live,negative

ive taught the alevels uk and the floridamichigan curriculum at international schools the us has a lot less focus than the uk americans are confused about what raising standards really entails foreign curriculum pushes students to master a smaller set of skills with smaller textbooks and more essay writing whereas the us focuses on a wider range of concepts with superficial multiple choice polling often this leads to foreign students having mastery and being well spoken about foundational concepts while american students win trivia night but cant really explain why the know something,neutral

lets perform it on a positive note the culture and ecology have to be healthy for starters schools have to be safe and secure it has to be supportive of learning curve for the students the student must take extreme ownership of the curricula the subject matters must be based on science learning methods must be evidencebased yes im a seasoned stem teacher by the way,positive
apologies for not watching the whole video as a former student and a parent of students i know the system was broken long before common core i remember in college my english 1 teacher had to give me a grammar guide because i was so deficient on the basicsthough i did well in english all through school i had to take remedial math because my high school didnt prepare me for college coursesthough i graduated with the required credits things have gone down since i was a student and my kids had schools with very high standards but very low expectations that means there were a lot of advanced classes offeredlike calculusbut so many ways to accept failure they had to take history and social studies but only had to pass one the policy of no child left behind was an additional failure as it meant no one failed or was held back even though they wouldnt graduate on time kids were just left in education limbo until they earned enough credits to be ousted too much government involvement means teachers arent allowed to teach we have some phenomenal teachers who are underpaid with far too much nonteaching responsibility heaped on them schools arent just expected to educate students now theyve got to feed them clothe them teach them manners and how to get along look out for abuse deal with all their special needs and accompanying ieps head off bullying deal with allergies and medical conditions worry about gender identity and sexuality discipline fairly deal with helicopter parents check the boxes for college prep and deal with the everpresent worry over school shootings with all were expecting from schools and teachers its a wonder anyone goes into this profession or stays once they see the outlook common core like no child left behind is a great idea on paper that fails in implementation my kids went to school at a time when the policy was to insure teachers were welleducated there was a push to make them go back to college for additional courses and they were tested themselves on what they were teaching their students it meant even more testing for studentsto judge whether their teachers were up to the task at the same time they removed a lot of incentive for teachers to do betterlike tenure they promoted the best teachers out of the classroom they took away teaching assistants due to the costs they increased class sizes and they started charter schoolswhich were experimental programs imagine if all those billions spent on common core were used to pay teachers moreand get out of their way,negative

ive been studying with the traditional academia style from my chidhood and i think this was one of the reasons of my deep unhappiness everytime i had to go to the school and i agree the system can be totally useless when it comes to study died things in only books and not providing experiential oportunities to learn for children its a very serious matter that i hope will dramatically change very soon i adapted to the system and became succesful in the studies but i can tell not in life sharing my experience all the best to you guys,negative
when i went to school in the sixties there was one program one track and it all revolved around completing workbooks memorizing facts and spewing them back in exams and in addition being judged on academic performance if memorizing and spewing dates and other facts counts as performance we were given a grade for citizenship a good grade in citizenship meant you didnt give the teachers any trouble you had learned to go along to get along a bad grade meant you were trouble and got a lot of negative attention from the vice principal i spent most of school particularly middle school in terror of making someone mad or being different it was a hateful experience,neutral
thanks well done sprouts and the visuals are just amazing deweys theory is certainly viable if there is proper funding for education it it is therefore easier to implement in a private school setting as compared to a public school one a critic would be how possible is it to find enough time within the term to implement the learning by doing eg planting and watching plants grow while at the same time covering the required syllabus for the discussions it is important that some teacher instructions and prior reading and research happens before for the discussiondebate to be meaningful enough to sprout out new perspectives and ideas for the interdisciplinary aspect to work very strong school leadership is essential as well as a strong teamwork culture among staff as it would require a lot of sharing consultations planning and constant reviews,positive

 these are some most important and precious advices every one should read  1 take risks in your life if you win you can lead if you lose you can guide 2 people are not what they say but what they do so judge them not from their words but from their actions 3 when someone hurts you dont feel bad because its a law of nature that the tree that bears the sweetest fruits gets maximum number of stones 4 take whatever you can from your life because when life starts taking from you it takes even your last breath 5 in this world people will always throw stones on the path of your success it depends on what you make from them a wall or a bridge 6 challenges make life interesting overcoming them make life meaningful 7 there is no joy in victory without running the risk of defeat 8 a path without obstacles leads nowhere 9 past is a nice place to visit but certainly not a good place to stay 10 you cant have a better tomorrow if you are thinking about yesterday all the time 11 if what you did yesterday still looks big to you then you havent done much today 12 if you dont build your dreams someone else will hire you to build theirs 13 if you dont climb the mountain you cant view the plain 14 dont leave it idle use your brain 15 you are not paid for having brain you are only rewarded for using it intelligently 16 it is not what you dont have that limits you it is what you have but dont know how to use 17 what you fail to learn might teach you a lesson 18 the difference between a corrupt person and an honest person is the corrupt person has a price while the honest person has a value 19 if you succeed in cheating someone dont think that the person is a fool realize that the person trusted you much more than you deserved i 20 honesty is an expensive gift dont expect it from cheap people i hope you have learnt something you can recieve more from my this channel,positive

this thing is also evident in india students preparing for neetjee and for many other competitive exams who pay lakhs of fees in coaching institutes get a remarkable edge over the students who cant afford to go to these coachings most of the teachers teaching at these institutes are iitians doctors etc these coachings provide great facilities to their students so the results are obvious there are very few government colleges of class 11 and 12 in india who actually prepare their students for these competitive exams also what i have noticed is that its not just the school that you go to matters but also the kind of peer group which you have also the support and thinking of your parents and the overall society and environment in which live matters when it comes to education,positive
an education that prepares learners for life after school i would really love to see this in my country we are trained to seek jobs so may graduates are frustrated by the education system most of them end up studying by staying in school all their lives as a defense mechanism our education needs to teach the mind heart and hands for us to be a bit more successful,neutral

im from india and here students can get admission to all the big universities only through an entrance exam due to covid the exams were postponed in april which is the usual time they happen now when the country has hit peak infection the central government has decided to hold all the exams at least 30 million students attempt these exams each year despite the clamour from the students and opposition the government is proceeding with it students have a long list of various concerns that are brushed aside 1 due to the rains many regions are flooded families displaced and property destroyed 2 transportation is nearly impossible some states have still not lifted the lockdown so trains buses and taxis are either unavailable or charge exorbitant rates 3 the exam centres are few and far between particularly in the rural areas without means of transportation students are unable to reach the exam centres even if they do manage to arrange for transport as hotels and restaurants are closed or open only for takeout they cannot find safe accomodation 4 many of the students have applied to multiple universities offering same or similar programs they all have entrance exams in september if a student tests positive due to any of these exams either he cannot take the exam or he infects hundreds of others when he attempts the paper despite the illness and like always the poor and disadvantaged in the country are suffering the most in this situation the government has offered no explanation or assurances for safety this is a no win situation for both students and their families the government has no solution that affects millions of students education and career other than to postpone the exam or hold the exam this is the state of education in india right now due to an incompetent government,neutral

a voice from cambodia  i came from a state owned school and finished my high school examination with a grade then i enrolled in a state owned university and completed my bachelor degree last month recently i joined a management trainee program to compete with other fresh graduate students in order to earn the top 5 spots to be qualified one of them was a girl that graduated from foreign countries she spent 3 years in singapore and one year in australia and i can see clearly see the difference between us in term of languages skills and knowledge it’s hard to stay being optimist because in reality students from rural areas in my countries don’t even know how to properly use a computer while those in urban areas ace this skill and other multiple skills since they were young to my knowledge one of the possible ways right now is to enrich the english language to the disadvantaged students and also creating high quality educating contents in our own language namely “khmer” ideally i hope those students will obtain the proficiency in english language then study the contents that suit their interests through educational media that vastly available at hand now,neutral

i used to work for those online tutoring companies they wanted native english speakers and promised you 16 but would dock your pay for things like yawning on screen the pace was insane i was fired for not smiling enough the burnout rate was very very high especially because you had to get up at about 4 am to do it if you lived in america the kids would be really young the youngest i tutored was 3 too young to understand anything at all and be in pajamas and finishing up their dinner so like the last thing they wanted to do was stare at a computer and learn english especially because the age range seemed to be 57yearolds sometimes they would pick up the laptop they were on and just run around the room with it and the parents would give us bad marks for not keeping their child engaged enough it was a really horrible job for both companies i worked for,negative

im 17 this year and am studying in an international high school in shenzhen china i was in public school until high school im grateful my parents provided me the opportunity to leave that stressful system but i heard from my former classmates who are in the system that in recent years the pressure on that system has been declining but i cant be assured because im no longer in that system recalling my dark days in that system ive always hated it because there was a lot of transcribing homework and memorizing poems and passages when you fail to remember them teachers will punish you by transcribing the poems and passages several times i understand the reason why our government has such a system because we have such a vast population and i do think its relatively fair even though its fairness is declining especially when this double reduction policy came down,negative
ive been an edtech consultant in beijing for 7 years ive also traveled to multiple provinces and smaller tier cities to evaluate and help schools there are multiple compounding factors as to why education is so subpar yet expensive the first and foremost factor i would note is the lack of public discourse this permeates through every part of society especially education if you are discouraged or not allowed to question things and people around you you end up missing a fundamental piece of being a good learner inquiry and reflection in education this comes in the strict form of rote knowledge even in history class theres no critical thinking or reflection involved it just becomes a bunch of facts to remember the second factor of note is barriers of information the public does not have easy access to a lot of internationally recognized academic content and even if they did get access they wouldnt be able to recognize it on top of that there are many misconceptions about education which are exaggerated by big businesses such as vipkids who outright lie to parents about standards and expectations this causes market distortion and other smaller business simply pick a recognizable brand name eg wonders and say thats their curriculum without any plan how to implement it the third factor is incompetence born from lack of actionable knowledge as stated in the first point most of the populations education revolves around rote knowledge and discourages reflection if youve been taught not to question things your whole life how can you be expected to teach others with inquiry based experiences and methodologies how can you be expected to recognize or create effective content to support those learning experiences the result usually ends up being copy pasting something they found online that looks good or fishing consultants like me for free content the fourth factor is lack of foreign talent there are not enough qualified teachers to meet demand the general population would not be able to recognize one either many companies hire russians call them american and slap a 200 markup on the course its up to the unqualified teacher to come up with the content instruction and meet the unrealistic expectations the decision makers sales people set for the parents the final factor is who the decision makers are who decides what national curriculum is starting in 2020 private schools have been forced to throw out foreign curriculum and adopt the national curriculum this topdown decision making only exasperates the situation it also permeates throughout the society ive been the unfortunate soul who has to coordinate curriculum development projects with the decision makers of these schools most of these decision makers are unqualified theyre sales people at best i should also mention that many parents have no clue about education yet influence the schools with their misconceptionsbut this is not the parents fault rather its the schools fault for not being professional enough to know how to manage expectations and implement a program as for price its simply about demand vs supply lack of foreign talent as mentioned before combined with a desperate middle class and higher trying to get their children in schools abroad at any cost they will pay upwards of 200k rmb just to make it happen for their little middle schooler unfortunately i exited the market partially because the clients i had to deal with were frustratingly incompetent and unwilling to address problemsmostly because the government outright banned foreign curriculum,negative
my sons were in chinese public schools until 8th and 9th grade respectively i am french and their mom and chinese so we thought it was important they at least attended a few years of school in the local system until the 6th grade the system does work and teaches them importance of hard work now as bicultural kids they were actually considered foreigners which in a way lessened academic pressure but also caused resentment especially for my older son from 6th grade onwards the pressure becomes pointless and is made worse because teachers and schools are incentivized on class results the worst of them will not hesitate to try and persuade weaker students to leave bullying by teachers can also occur my youngest son went all the way to the zhongkao and got accepted into a top local high school but then asked if he could go to an international school he went to a very selective one but probably has only half the workload of his former classmates this 2021 reform only focused on alleviating some financial burden what it didnt do is address some fundamental issues with the system teachers are not incentivized to help weaker students instead they push them out everything is based on 2 tests one in grade 9 and one in grade 12 these tests are extremely hard but also very narrow and focus on rote learning but do not do enough to help kids develop analytical skills even if that has improved a bit system should be reformed to take equivalent of gpa into account this would ease a lot of the pressure the last 5 years of high school are spent on passing 2 exams rather than help students grow there is a little that is learnt in those 5 years to help them transition to higher education yes most of them will have strong language and math skills but a lot of it is mechanical some families were using tutors to develop the analytical side of things so at least the ministry should also have reformed part of the curriculum,neutral
education has become competitive for parents to make their children worthy in this world to competent other for their future its not only happening in china in other fast growing cities its better to divide studies according to grade rather pressure the kid at early agenowadays parents are feeding kids with vitamins and many nutrients to improve their brain function but they didnt think the world most top renowned scientists never had this facilities,neutral
the problem i have with those overly stressful education systems is that i wonder if they actually work and if the students learn effectively through them what i learned through selfdefense practice and military documentaries is that stress and anxiety seem to decrease your ability to focus and are not an effective way to learn in selfdefense instructors increase stress by making you do cardiobased exercises to make your body artificially feel stress accelerated heartbeat difficulty to breath difficulty to focus only to test your ability to reproduce the technique properly when your focus is the least optimal but they dont do it for learning purposes the military seems to do it too in their own way i would also point out that every doctor in the world with common sense would tell you that there is a considerable difference between the way we think we perform under fatigue and the way we actually perform under fatigue its funny how the little girl in the video who had an allegedly stressfree education in kindergarten was able to catch up with her classmates in a few months i wonder how the students who went through this type of education system would perform against students from other countries here in france we dont have that type of education system nor in the united kingdom i studied for 2 years at a british university,negative
i never really agreed with this kind of education system i live in malaysia my earliest childhood memories were ever only filled with tuitions left and right no play until you finish your homework if you fail to memorise spellings you will be punished back then i never really thought much of it but now that i’m in college being exposed to a more western type of education system made me question this kind of practice it never helpd me improve my academic i was always dead last in class all it ever did to me was lowering my self confidence and give me anxiety im never going back to those times,negative

i found this very interesting and as someone with adhdi i had a lot of hyperfocused thoughts about it it brought up so many points of interest with in each of these is the fact that education was built upon the industrial revolution adhd is considered an epidemic of our time and our factory type of education destroys or ability for divergent thinking from the start of the industrial revolution the idea became that people should work in factories and large businesses as time went on this idea continued but in a different way by the 1920s there was a drive towards raising the standards of living people were encouraged overtime to get out of the cities where they worked and live in the suburbs in a house get married and join a standard stereotype where the women stayed home to raise to raise their children and the men went to work hopefully using the education they gained to obtain this idealistic life style but like he said in the talk this type of trend doesnt work anymore styles of life are so divergent and its obvious that not everyone can get a high paying job resulting from higher education and all women arent going to be stay at home moms and many cant actually during the 60s many women questioned their identities and blamed their education for giving them delusions of using their education later in life and as we see today many people are educated for a different experience than the one they will actually be living as for adhd it most certainly exists but is caught up in the confusion of our factory like education and the experience of being a distracted average child i believe adhd is both a cause and symptom of behavior but not always both take your eyes for example you get your eyes tested at a young age because your having trouble seeing clearly so you get prescription lenses you now wear these lenses for the rest of your life and often have to upgrade to a stronger prescription and no one asks why no one asks why are you like this how did it happen or if they do they say your genetically predisposed to it yes and no you can be genetically predisposed to be more likely to develop many types of conditions but it depends on the right or wrong conditions being met becoming near sighted or far sighted for instance is determined on three factors your nutrition your genetics and your life style actually some people have totally reversed their bad eye sight by changing their diet and their habits for instance a child who stays inside all day watching tv and playing videogames for hours refuses to eat his vegetables and whos parents or relatives have had glasses may develope near sightedness so in relation a child who has been mentally watching tv and playing videogames all day not spending any time practicing how to use their creativity exploring their real world developing interests in things that are natural and not directly stimulating interacting socially with others around them making constant decisions based on logic real feelings and experiences and most importantly practicing natural real motivation skills in combination with poor nutrition and specific genetics will very likely not develope mentally in the healthiest manner and it doesnt just go for adhd this could be a cause for any mental disability or difficulty in varying degrees of course but it is believed that behavior in any form is partially learned and partially developed and by developed i mean the way your brain developed how your nutrition and your experience shaped the way your brain works going back to education you can see why this factory mind set cant work for everyone as well as when you compair the standard disaplines of our modern education with the arts you find contradiction most people dont understand the arts most people wonder how the arts became so chaotic to the point it doesnt make sense anymore truth is that area of education evolved but only by those who pursue it would understand a big part of the confusion is this idea of perfection that envelopes the academic world the a grade is the pinacle of that idea do perfectly in your education and you get an a well this doesnt really work in the art world you still get graded when you do your work and do it well but school is for practicing the academics in art you study academics as well like art history art theory and your use of a medium like drawing or painting what you dont get graded on is on the things that cant be measured like your idea your creativity and the value of your work though in some cases your graded on how well you show a specific idea or use a specific skill but when it comes right down to it art isnt about any of this or it can be about all of it it can be about how others value your work it can be about how divergent your work seems to be it can be about how well your work matches a subject it can be about how well you use methods of design it can be about what kind of thoughts or feeling it brings up in people and it can be about how it compairs and is judged among a group of people who hold a specific adjenda or opinion in matters that are or are not artistic or intrinsic aka art competition or auction so in a way it is chaotic to the point people cant make sense of it any more but it is not inherently measurable and perfected it is the product of ideas and ideas are valued above all else and yet in education art is set in a lower bar of importance in all its forms and is confused with this idea of perfection and conformaty,positive

ive been listening to this guys speeches all day and it just resonates with me more than anything i have seen in a long time i was misdiagnosed with adhd in elementary school this wonderful psychologist actually told me in 5th grade that it was a misdiagnosis so i know so i spent 5 years believing i had adhd when all i had was this thing called childhood eventually in 10th grade i switched to an alternative school and everything robinson has said regarding alternative schools in his other speeches is spot on im a senior at my alternative school going to college next year and this school has had a profound impact on me ill spare the details but i just want to confirm that alternative schools are very often the solution and right now what im most passionate about is making this education revolution happen and i will do everything in my power to achieve this i wouldnt have this passion if it were not for my alternative school experience which inspired learning instead of forcing conformity much thanks to ken robinson for his words of wisdom and innspiration andsharing his vision with us,positive

i certainly remember being much better at being creative when i was younger but now that im a freshman in high school ive noticed that im much worse at the whole creativity thing now the problem is im being praised why i am great at finding the one answer i can take tests very well but am typically not the best at projects math is my best subject english is my worst where you typically have to write creative essays i want to be an engineer so at my school we have an elective called preengineering its one of the closest classes to an actual job thats available at my school and im not the best at it sure i can do the math required but coming up with ideas for better designs is hard i feel that this shows that my education is doing the opposite of preparing me for the future its telling me that theres one answer which is never the case in engineering i hope that soon enough we can have an education overhaul and realize that we need to change education,negative

respect for teachers is not just about the salary although an increase in salary is sorely needed teacher pay has always been lower than other professions with the same education and experience its also about respect for the profession student behavior in my view can be linked to the disrespect for teachers theyre seeing parents administrators and politicians demonstrate hiring a person trained as a soldier to teach is very disrespectful to the profession as a teacher i dont feel qualified to do the job of a soldier i respect the profession too much the anybody can teach attitude is not only insulting its ignorant,negative

as someone whos from md and lives in pa pennsylvania came higher than i expected and maryland was lower baltimore probably dragged maryland down but pa is a surprise thats because pennsylvania schools are funded through a system called school taxes where each of the 500 school districts spread across 67 counties levy their own property taxes to fund their schools thats why someone living next door to you can be paying twice as much in taxes to go to a school half as good this system has been known to disproportionately affect rural and urban school districts and tip in favor of school districts in suburban communities or those in the poconos where they have resorts that people own condos at,negative

according to wallethub the best state in the country for “quality of education” is massachusetts followed by california according to research released january 21 2019 by wallethub the study was part of wallethub’s annual ranking of the “most least educated states in america” this year’s ranking combined two categories — educational attainment and quality of education — broken down by 20 “relevant metrics” massachusetts placed first in both categories followed by california while the educational attainment category is based solely on the percentage of residents with high school associates undergraduate and graduate diplomas quality of education includes 16 metrics ranging from quality of public high schools to quality of public universities to educational attainment based on gender and race within that category california follows massachusetts rounding out the top five for quality of education are florida maryland and vermont respectively,positive
i grew up in mass and the schools were excellent that said my kids go to school in los angeles and there are some great public schools here my daughter went to a french immersion public school in glendale ca i felt like she got a pretty amazing and unique education,positive
the closest i got to college was watching the professor on gilligans island that must put me a few points ahead,positive
im from ca and i find this super surprising while overall our stats suck when you look at the exceptions the smart kids here astound me at dimanomd bar i knew this kid who was talking calc 1 as a sophmore in high school i also met this taiwanese girl who was taking data structures and algorithms at 16 and recently got into uc berkeley i think while overall our stays suck our top scholars here can top other scholars after all the uc system has some of the most prestigious universities according to us news,positive
would have been nice to see what per student funding was per state as well see which states are getting a return for their dollar or correlation between and funding and results,neutral
nothings wrong with going to college its the fact that we are traditionally taught that we all need to go to college to be successful when in fact college isnt for everyone and especially isn’t the only way to succeed in life same people that tell you to go to college are paying debt still from it how the rich stay rich and poor stay poor,negative
exactly as a member of genx a lot of us are still paying off our loans but yet are gonna send our kids to do the same thing 20 years later i think not i say this as a person with a bachelors and masters degree i encourage young people to get as much education for free or as cheaply as they can the important thing is output if you produce good work academic or otherwise youll always be in demand with the internet people are able to start all sorts of income producing ventures without high overhead you can become a software programmer using tutorials online and make plenty of money you can learn a trade with only two years of study via community college if youve got the mind to start your own company afterwards then get a business degree when youre able to pay as you go you can learn digital marketing without a degree,positive
my son is a senior in high school this year he says he might choose community college but doesnt want a 4 year university trade school is fine too i think he just doesnt know what he wants to do with his life yet and thats okay i went to college and spent 12 years paying it off just to decide later that social work was not for me i dont understand why kids have to rush into a lifelong career when they havent even had the opportunity to live life yet i want my child to explore different career paths before he chooses one im in no rush to kick him out all i ask is that he works or goes to school i dont want him to be out on his own until he has money saved in the bank and a stable job i want him to know how to budget and manage his finances properly i dont want him to struggle living paycheck to paycheck trying to make ends meet he can go to college anytime if he chooses to do so theres no age limit,negative
as a millenial i cant help feeling like we were the experiemental group with university somehow how much could colleges charge and get away with how far can they upsell this idea of helping people get better jobs by going in debt for the rest of their lives its ridiculous that celebrating paying off student loans is even a thing in the first place now that the next gen has seen the effects they are only taking logical next steps to ensure their own security universities is just way too expensiveon top of that theres cost of housing and food and transportation if it were more affordable i truly believe more kids absolutely would go but if someone in that position asked me for advice i would always advise them to at least complete community college and 2 year degrees or certification programs at the very least in a practical field many include internships that have great potential to lead to decent jobs,negative
i find this so awesome i hope these colleges are forced to significantly drop their prices they sucked american students dry crippled an entire generation of millennials from being homeowners and ever building financial security now its finally coming to a head and its long overdue i hope students find great jobs and stay out of debt,positive
i started my career in the food industry as a shelf stocker at a grocery store then was promoted to merchandiser then to a buyer a vendor later asked me to join them doing sales fast forward to today i’m 36 still doing sales but now in the seafood industry and make about 150k gross annually not bad for someone that didn’t go to college find what you’re good at and work hard at it college isn’t for everyone,positive
this was inevitable university tuition kept skyrocketing over the past 20 years tuition has greatly outpaced both inflation and incomes for collegeaged students the entire millennial generation became de facto indentured servants from their college debt basically financial slaves to their debt education can be very useful for employment goals but there are limits and we are approaching that limit from a cost to value perspective generation z is not stupid and they are declining to voluntarily set themselves up for a lifetime of paying back student debt trust me gen z you do not want to find yourself in that situation it will steal years if not decades from your life and you will never get that time back also most skills of the high demand and lucrative software engineering tech jobs are not taught in college but rather can be learned just as easily by anyone with a cheap internet connection and sufficient motovationfocus its common for software developers to earn 6 figure salaries with no college at all companies do not care where you went to school or even of you went they only care if you have the skills that can help solve their business problems how you go about acquiring those skills is totally irrelevant the company doesnt care if you learned to program java at college or on your own its high time that universities start to feel the sting to their annual profits as more 17 and 18 year olds wake up and push back on the cost of attending college,neutral
they are smart to opt out ive been going to school my entire life im 48 and enjoy learning there is no difference between high school and community colleges there is also no guarantee you will find work with a degree just because you have a degree doesnt mean your work is good professors will rarely tell you if your portfolio is good because they dont care the institution they work for already have their money technical colleges used to be different but they too are falling into the hands of ceo executives who think they know how to run a college colleges also dont let teachers teach the price of education is not worth it you get a better education from the university of youtube which most teachers use to teach,neutral
when education becomes a business instead of a right this is what happens,negative
well lets consider this most nations give free college to their citizens here in the us however we charge them to attend colleges that would make our nation more educated and more adept at highskilled jobs its almost like we want our population to suffer while we are going threw an economic crisis but hey lets ignore that completely right,negative

thank gta for putting some classics on the radio hits different when your cruising down the highway and this comes on,positive
if you dont like hall and oates then you probably dont like music,negative

if you allow young people to be inquisitive creative and selfreliant they will educate themselves throughout their adult lives childhood should be seen as a sacred phase of development and education as a means of the individual to empower themselves as and when they choose to not a punishment to be inflicted upon the unwilling until they are ready to enter the ranks of workers bureaucrats and managers,neutral
is no one gonna point out that russells a way better moderator than 99 of journalists and academics that interview him nowadays,neutral
russel brand did a really good job here he made the interview light and enjoyable and at the same time probed yuval to go deeper into his ideas than ive seen him go in other interviews,positive
it seems to me that the purpose of life is to contribute to society and do good things and the purpose of education is to learn how to interpret and understand the world students need to learn the language of the world they need a good solid understanding of the basics then they can adapt to anything and be better prepared to contribute,positive
oh how i love russell brand listen to him praise the students for the quality of their questions he is such a great example of raising each other up,positive
you know philosophers are very very patent peoplethey can argue for thousands of years about some ethical dilemma without resolution,neutral
to become a selfguided learner start with platos dialogues on education how do you know what you need to know until after youve learned it how can you tell what is true these were considered crucial questions then that needed urgent answers,neutral
thanks for this its so relevant and i heard some excellent questions and i liked the way they were answered and how sometimes brand translated or summed up hararis answers it made things even more clear and focussed than the talks and interviews i had watched and read in the past little while the audience was fabulous and asked the best questions ever,positive
great discussion thank you yuval said early in his talk that we should look to our governments to ensure that the youth of today receive the kind of education they need to survive in the future i would suggest that national politicians are likely to be the future useless people my government in africa has done nothing to help the people all it has done is line the pockets of the politicians education is already being reengineered today by the private sector udacity coursera come to mind there are huge changes taking place through these and other similar organisations and their association with universities around the world so the future of the youth of today depends on them thomas friedman in his book thank you for being late suggests that the previous digital divide between the educated and the lesser educated has gone and the new divide is the motivational divide the youth of today need to be intrinsically motivated and overcome the natural laziness that yuval tells us about and learn and keep learning what they need to know is what to learn then learn it with the help of the internet organisations like udacity khan academy coursera and coaches and mentors teachers in the world of yesterday schools also need to embrace these changes,neutral
coming to this in 2020 isolated and away from my kids thousands of km awaymy son chose to read theology i had read law politics and economics and retain a keen interest in these areas i had discouraged his choice and questioned it i was probably wrong,negative
india is a country of a billion people but if anyone ever says that stuff again ask them what is the addressable market for their product and watch the fun ill bet my money 99 of these so called entrepreneurs dont know how big their market actually is thats why they can never convert their company into conglomerates,negative
ive started company twice once when in college and again internationally i noticed that india largely emulates the us way of doing things in reality we should follow the uk model that means unit economics first and market dominance next and not vice versa,neutral
really value of an iit or iim is not in their curriculum its in the students who get into these institutions after beating lakhs of people,neutral
i dont know why people dont watch interviews they are as insightful if not more,negative
you never disappoint ,positive
masters union cannot replace institutions like iim or iit because of the sheer fact that mu does not have to comply with the guidelines of a college or a university indian colleges or universities dont have any place in the top institutes of the world and rightly so but something that an iit or iim has to deal with that none of the other institutes in the world deals with is the implementation of the reservation policy because of the implementation of reservation there is a possibility that a huge chunk of the people who get into iims and iits be lacking in certain core subjects dont assume i am a casteist because i am outlining a drawback in reservation policy i completely support the reservation policy and every caste is now enjoying the benefit of reservation and so the faculty of these institutions have to compensate for this drawback and this becomes a huge stepback in achieving wonderful things within a span of 200 years but the reservation policy gives students from poor and rural backgrounds who havent had access to great education in their schoolscolleges an access to great education when it comes to their higher education but in an institution like masters union going by their fees structure and the absence of any deferral of fees payment or scholarship the students generally come from priveleged backgrounds who have had access to great education since kindergarten while masters union assures great education institutions like iits and iims ensure social equity and great education the entire para is based on my knowledge that there are no reservations in mu,negative

first of all silvers videos are just getting better and better what a guy second tarpor is one of the best leaders weve seen in a civ event absolutely incredible video filled with so much emotion and such a phenomenal plot,positive
i had a hunch that the survivors would win even with their low quality gear i knew because they had spirit determination and unity thats what makes an army strong,positive
the antiscientists taking advantage of silvers joke to decieve the others was genius,neutral
love how the anticure scientists just gaslit their way into the survivors’ side i feel like we didn’t really get to see how much the mutant zombies pestered the teams though i suppose that might just mean there weren’t really any notable events aside from what was shown guess their fellow man was enough of an enemy already,neutral

i d e a for new civilization experiment nations are split on the big continent and a small lake isle in the center of continent the nations are plains boost to farming and gathering resources get more of them they have additional heart in ther region but they have 1 heart in other regions so making a nation to defend rather then attack structures castle and village next to it jungle jump higher and get much lower fall damage can build special sorts of bases i guess but 1 heart overall structures aztec temple and village on trees desert loses less hunger bars over time other nations in their region lose 1 heart but the desert people lose 1 heart in other regions like the plains structures a pyramid and a trading post swamp their potions are more effective and lasting they dont need to kill blazes to make potions but they have 1 heart in their region structures giant witch hut islanders live on their own island faster swimming on boats and themselves better fishing efficiency but the isle is little and not much land is fertile that makes them invade others structures seaport dock and coastal village snow it is very cold there and people are brutal they are 2 heart s in the beginning but for every kill they get 1 heart that makes them an aggressive unstable society but they can eat only meat because they probably have never seen vegetables structures igloo village plus viking fort mountains quick diggers 15x speed structures forgotten mine dvarvish fortress the situation of the regions snow mountains plains islanders swamp jungle desert,neutral

stoked to finally get a cape i missed the boat on the migration cape my ancient mojang account from 2010ish is long lost to history but i did buy both versions on pc years ago and bought it on mobile back in 2013 or 14 goodbye optifine cape hello official cape,neutral
i am excited for the prospect that like the example test vote the mob vote may last a longer period of time like 24 hours because they usually happen at like 3am my time hopefully a larger section of the playerbase will end up getting to vote with the new system,positive
i feel a bit ripped off by the cape i bought both versions of the game but bedrock edition on the xbox and java well on a pc i still bought both versions since windows 10 and xbox are the exact same but i will not be getting the cape since you had to buy windows 10 and xbox separately meaning they see them as two different items though it’s the exact same version of the game just different platforms edit they are indeed the same email of course though they might hopefully surprise me and this is just a worry about nothing,positive
im glad that they are doing a change to the voting system i remember last year it was a hassle to make a twitter account just to vote for the copper golem and for it to not win,neutral
it’s a better system but if they do another mob before adding the old ones im gonna have an aneurysm,neutral
i liked the broken audio version better felt like we could hear inside toycat’s head,positive
the goal of capes is to be a reward for a thing and to be rare and there are some that are rarer than others now it’s just one more cape in the wild of all the minecraft account some capes are more rare adding an account more value because you deserved it,positive
i hope if theyre going to use this server for voting issues the server can handle the traffic else it will be a very laggy experience for all of us,negative

question is there a specific reason why you recommend taking the sat twice i heard a lot that getting a 1500 or above is a mark that for example colleges dont look too deeply into whether you got a 1500 or 1540 not too big of a deal so if i were to get a 1500 the first time should i really take it again,neutral
i have a sat in 10 days and i have not prepared that much please pray for me ,neutral
im an international student so im taking the test in december in 2023 the format is completely changing for students outside the us so would you still recommend taking the test again,neutral

notes all the information you’ll need will be on the test whether it’s in the passage or the little introduction brief before reading the passage skim the questions to see if there’re any summarytheme questions and take note of the vocab words remember to read the titlelittle introduction for vocab questions read the whole sentence plus maybe the sentences before and after for context then substitute in each answer know what certain terms are 704 for twopart questions look at the second part and highlight all the quotes in the passage then read the first question only the question and try to see which quote answers every part of the question compare the quote to the first question’s answers for the literature passage try to be engagedto have fun read challenging books beforehand for the debate passages read the first passage and answer all the passage1specific questions while it’s still fresh in your mind repeat for passage 2 especially for the sciencebased passages don’t infer anything use the passagegraphs to back up each answer,neutral

ive been studying on khan academy for a couple of weeks now using their sat practice problems watching you do this has helped me so much more than that has thus far thanks,positive
ive taken the sat 3 times the most frustrating part about the sat is that unless youre at an advanced level in math or above the normal level for your grade theres a high chance you wont understand or even recognize over 50 of the material and questions the first time i took it i barely understood a lot of the math on it because i wasnt even completely through algebra 2 long story short i hate standardized testing and i feel as though a lot of kids are set up for failure tt im lucky i got to take it multiple times this year since i understand most of the math now,negative

my tip if you know you’re taking the act study for that first the timing of the act is much faster so if you study hard and get used to it the sat will seem like a piece of cake at least that’s how it was for me,positive
honestly for me at least knowing that there will be another opportunity really relieved my test anxiety and i ended up with a much better score than i predicted,positive
that’s so funny… we got the exact same first two sat scores 1190 and 1360 hoping that’s a good sign and through hard work and dedication there will be a 1510 in my future,positive

i’ve been watching since freshmen year heading into my senior year now i self studied with many tips from here and got a 1500 today thank you,positive
thanks for sharing i am really glad you put this video in the context of what schools the student is looking to apply to since sat scores are all relative since i score a 1500 it blows my mind to think about being in the top 99 i think the part about scores being inflated because schools dont have to report bad test scores since students arent submitting bad tests scores makes sense however i do tell my students that submitting scores is beneficial to them if they can because the us world news report requires a school to report at least 50 of its students scores in order for them to remain competitive in the rankings thus more elite schools will take more students with scores than without to maintain their coveted spots,positive
hi brooke ive been watching your videos for a while and was able to score a 1560 as a junior my subscores are both 780 which is causing me a dilemma because i want to go into engineeringcs my total score is at the 75th percentile or higher for almost every school im applying to but my math is at the lower end for my intended major some places should i retake to get a 790 or 800 or will it not make much difference,neutral
hey brooke would a 1520 superscored sat made from a 1490 780m 710e and a 1450 710m 740e be looked down upon by schools that have 1520 right at the bottom of the middle 50 would raw 1520 be a considerable improvement,neutral
hi i´m an international student do you think i have to take sat and submit my test scores how important is that for a class of 2028 especially if i want to get into a good university,neutral
hi brooke great video as always quick question do you think the sat will serve of any relevance for students of the class of 2027 and beyond regards,positive

to be honest about this whole thing youre right you dont have to study the knowledge you accumulated from 9th to 1112th grade all you have to know are the tricks wealthy people pay just for this to the test and thats the only way possible to get a high score its like a very special system to weed out the people who cant afford to go to college i feel sorry for this because education should be affordable to all,negative
retaking it tomorrow got a 940 last time so let’s hope it goes well this time edit i got a 1070,positive
read questions first actually read the passage main theme question for last keep unknown word in mind link up the line evidence and best understood questions take advantage of the pairs choose the best answer there is only one writing underline main subject single or compound and main verb in sentence if either answer is interchangeable neither is the answer semi colons and periods and colons sometimes read through the whole paragraph before you answer question,neutral

half the comments on this video are “lol you guys think the sat is hard wait til you learn about insert random country’s standardized test” the discussion surrounding this video shouldn’t be “mine is harder and therefore better” it should be about how bad standardized testing is and how it really isn’t a measure of intelligence just of taking the test,negative

when i was in high school i took all general courses and got a 22 on the act average i am now in medical school at the 64th percentile of my class all of which were honorap students with 30 act scores and straight as in high school national testing doesnt look at one of the most important factors in people determination and resilience,neutral

i just graduated from law school and attended washington u in st louis for my undergrad it is so interesting seeing all of these people a few years behind me talk about stats scores and extracurriculars yale and other elite schools can really and truly set you up for life but just remember if your scores aren’t this amazing or you don’t get into your dream school you still have a wonderful life ahead of you i’ve taken classes at community college public universities and private universities and your education really is what you make of it college is only a few years out of the rest of your life and i wish in high school i had known that and spent more time making memories and less time worried about my gpa just my two cents and amazing that all of these students are so accomplished at such young ages,positive

as fun as these videos are i do want to give a certain amount of warning to hs students just because you have the grades scores letters of rec essays and extracurriculars doesn’t mean you’ll be accepted into these schools i was denied to all of my colleges despite having a 38423 a 1490 and being on a nationally recognised robotics and rocketry team i even did robotics research in hs at a university applied to the university and then was denied from that university so much of it is just an arbitrary lottery it’s hard to truly know,negative
256 and 319 having a 44 ib predicted score is way more impressive than getting a 40 gpa we have a monster on our hands,positive
this is unknown territory for me its fascinating i dropped out of high school in 10th grade due to multiple reasons but mostly due to feeling overwhelmed and lost without any guidance im proud of these kids cause they dont all come from privilege they worked hard,positive

jehovah i pray that everyone watching this very helpful vid scores a 1500 on the upcoming sat amen,positive
i got a 1590 on my sat using strategies similar to the ones you recommend so this guy is legit y’all if you get anything out of this it’s to take the time to fully understand the passage the only caution i’d have with your strategies is to avoid any sort of generalizing as you did with finding the word that fits in context while that is the case most of the time i’ve seen collegeboard switch it up before they’re rude like that you’re killing it tho keep up the good content,positive

dont stress about it you have the pressure of scoring in the 90th percentile and not doing the worst out of all your friends your family is counting on you to get a scholarship and go to a top school its highly competitive youre competing not only with kids in your state but students in all 50 states and this is basically the test of your lifeother than the grad school exams mcatthat determines community college or top university and the difference towards getting more money towards your pay check sure dont stress about it,neutral
this is the entire problem with the sat system its not about the knowledge its the tricks in taking the exam things like sat prepping and all other things should not be encourage when taking it in real statistics term the results you get from taking the test are false because youve practice to jacked up your score,negative
they got high scores i got a 1800 and i thought i did good,positive
no way these sat scores were accurate 2300 out of 2400 yea okay someone doesnt know how the scoring works,negative
first of all let me clear up the misunderstanding about why asians do well in life we do not always send kids off to academic supplements sat study classes etc obviously there are those parents are ultimately force their child to go but there are a plethora that do just as well if not better on these types of activities sat act gpa school etc without any additional help aside from a practise test book from the local library that is me and i can affirm that for many asian kids we have an inherent need to do good make our parents proud no matter how much pressure we have and have a highlevel job and go to ivy league schools in order to help support our parents later in life since they spend all of their savings on us we push for the best because of our work ethic not because all asians have oh so much money for the majority of our parents as immigrants it is nearly impossible to imagine the labour the hard work the exhaustion and the prejudice they have faced in the past all to provide their children with more opportunities it is not that asians are inherently smarter or richer or more privileged in any ways although there are those select few but because of the bitterness we have faced to shape us into who we are today asians are no different from others of ethnic origin to say mexicans africanamericans indians and other disprivileged minorities in the states the only difference is how we choose to approach life and its difficulties do we lie down and wait for others to donate things to us or do we choose to fight until the end i am not trying to start up any racial slurs cursing or insultations of any kind just putting out a thought and consideration for you all obviously there are many successful talented and kind people from all ethnic origins as well as bad ones but i am just making a point here why would the highlevel universities offer an easier acceptance rate based on race rather than achievement if they did not truly believe in the concept of racial preference or racial advantage note i put that in quotations meaning i myself do not think that is a fact there are hardworking and lazy people smart and ignorant good and bad in any race it is just how we choose to present ourselves and represent our beliefs and race to the rest of the generalising public so tell me why should one race get more sympathy or preference over another can we not just all be equal human beings it is like saying red is better than pink why oh because it is true without an explanation so what the lady teacher in the video says really hit me due to how personal it felt as a 10th grade chinese girl and i wanted to share the truth to everyone thank you for understanding with an open heart and mind and hopefully we can all start changing society little by little with messages like this no enmities i hope,positive

the fact that they don’t score on a curve is a completely lie and was contradicted in the video what do u call saying that one test is harder than another so they can get more wrong even if this is true there are so many ways to combat this with still making sure that there is no cheating this is especially true in the math section where y literally have to change numbers because the concepts that you are testing should be the same or relatively similar and even though this may be harder for the english section when it comes to the documents and essay there are still many ways to make sure that there is not too much of a differentiation that it would merit a curve because there is no other word for what ur doing,negative

thank you for the info im a brazilian student struggling if its worth applying to the us i did a indepth research some “mock” sat’s at home and have a strong sympathy for certain american colleges education structure as compared to brazilian or european universities which im fortunate to have the citizenship in both places nevertheless if i do decide to take this time to apply and commit to this dream that has grown on me in the past few years i’d have to eliminate one of my options whether usp in brazil or epfl in switzerland due to the amount of time set into both while balancing my studies for the local admissions testfuvestusp the epfl’s entrance exams in french and a few ec’s i obtained a couple of 1550 scores at home following all the procedures as timemonitored tests i judge my english as nearfluent since i have been taking classes since i was 9 above all i have a strong passion for physics mathematics and technologiesmainly ai related to physics research i also would be prone to take sat ii and possibly ap exams as well as the toefl to sum up with my 96 out of 10 gpa my main concern involves my financial background and my lack of extracurriculars related to my major of interest math or physics with computer science i have participated weekly in two educational nfos since i was in middle school and more recently online with administrative work some calls and at the end of the pandemic as a teacher which i loved i had acoustic guitar lessons in the same period mentioned until i started piano lessons one year ago i have been taking english and french private lessons for 4 years and played varsity statelevel soccer being the captain until the pandemic started i acknowledge and feel this excitement for applied maths and physics pushing me to possibly pursue a career in academia and live i life i wont regret however i awfully believe that my extracurriculars arent good enough for top 20 schools and im inclined to study in epfl where id have an amazing education but entirely different from what ive expected as the holistic formation to some eclectic interests that i also have in history and art back to my financial means im entirely grateful for the opportunities that i already have and a possible new pursuit would be limited to an investment of 25000 per year from my parents by converting my mother’s income to usd35000 we would qualify for 100 financial support from needbased universities and those would be my goals my question is am i a strong applicant for america’s a1 universities undergrad or have i lost my chance by not investing in a passion project,positive

truly inspiring video the presentation is truly flawless and the few frames of minecraft gameplay captures the essence of the game i love how you used pocket edition because its unique and different than most minecraft videos being published today using pc or console versions of the game and i really think this choice sets you away from the others and makes you stand out also the landscape presented in the few frames really captures the urgency of the situation and how you want to hold on to the game as long as possible before you give in to the urge to scratch your testicles i really love the decision to be in a gray cobblestone base as the gray really gives a feeling of sadness as you will only be able to play the game for so little time before needing to submit to the feeling of discomfort in your testicles only able to be relieved by scratching them also the choice to place torches in the shelter symbolizes the small time you have hope to keep going even though the situation seems tough and the darkness is surrounding if you observe the items the player is holding during the gameplay we can find that the player is holding a torch just like the many around his shelter this means the torches around the base has just been placed and shows how you can move forward in life no matter how dire the situation may seem in the other hand you can find a stone sword which symbolizes the battle needed to resist the constant suffering of feeling a slight skin discomfort in the testicular area and how much you can fight through it and do your best no matter what also the usage of a sword in shelter holds a really deep meaning showing how even if someone is in their home they are never safe of the dangers outside and that they always should be careful and attentive of their surroundings to ensure their safety i also appreciate the 4 chests in the form of a rectangular shape which shows the balance of a mans possessions and how you need to hold on to all you have because you never know if something might happen requiring you to exit the software due to an unforgiving feeling in the balls not to mention the way the player looks out the exit as if the player is looking out into the giant world around them thinking of all they could accomplish and how they might get there and how even though you may be small compared to the universe the impact you make can change the world another very symbolic part of this film is the ending where the player thanks everyone for viewing his video even though it took the viewer though a lot of ups and downs emotionally but they still stayed through to the end to show support for the players dedication it also is in a slightly smaller frame and black bars replace the outer edges which show that even though you try your best there is still endless uncertainty on how your choices impacted your journey and how much different it could have been if you have done something different which creates a paradox of endless possibilities which could have spiraled out of one simple task of playing the game of minecraft as long as possible without itching ones testicles the background is blue behind white text which shows how the creator felt blue or sad about ending but still proud of what they accomplished and is hopeful for what is to come a really poetic performance really captures the ups and downs needed to be overcome in what seems to be a simple sandbox game can be dramatically multiplied with the added challenge of persevering through the hardships of avoiding the constant urge to scratch ones balls i cant wait to see more work from you 1010 simply phenomenal,positive

heres what i got from this this man is a very good lawyer and still believes in the law it was no mistake that he mentioned twice that he would never do anything unethical and he would tell the threats and other bullcrap to stop what he didnt say was that we all know both of those things go very against trumps mo he is a very wise lawyer not to get mixed up in trump,neutral
well we know he has one attorney that has had to go to jail for him another attorney who is about to be indicted and another attorney testifying in front of the january 6th committee so i think its safe to say that most smart attorneys are not going to think that representing this man is worth it plus they know they wont get paid,negative

i can see why he is a good lawyer from just this short interview he side stepped politics he side stepped trump and he side stepped angering trumps followers   all the while being respectful to everybody he is in a different class and not a mud slinger he has his own reputation to think about smart and honest people dont get involved with trump,neutral

personally i think education or specifically a lack thereof is one of the strongest driving forces behind things like this because ignorance breeds fear and distrust especially in things that are new or foreign when i was in elementary school back in the 70s i was reading my way through my schools scifi section it was just a few shelves but it had almost all the classics asimov bova bradbury campbell clarke doc smith heinlein and then i got to verne id just finished up 30000 leagues and was getting into journey to the center of the earth when i found a page had been ripped from the book being a good student i reported it to the librarian but instead of focusing on the missing page she was outraged that i was reading this particular book it was above my level she said and too difficult for me this was a hundredyearold story at this point and i was pretty sure it wasnt a difficult one to follow the movie was even one of my favorites every time it aired on creature feature on saturdays but she still took the book away and over the next few weeks that scifi section became empty shelves as she removed and locked away almost all the books there a short time later i overheard her talking to another teacher about of all things a shooting star a meteor that many had seen a night or two before the librarian was mocking the teacher because a shooting star is impossible the heavens are permanent the stars dont move as the teacher tried to explain the idea of a meteor it seemed to both terrify and outrage her and the longer that conversation went on the more even i maybe 10 or 11 years old at the time realized the scifi books she had removed werent above my level they were above her level she had no understanding of science and all these scifi stories about starships robots and alien worlds were things that she just didnt understand and because of that they scared her so she locked them away and unfortunately it sounds like that sort of mindset hasnt changed all that much in the 40 or so years since then,negative
whenever i heard a book was banned from my school library i would immediately check it out from the public library i learned a lot about menstruation from “dear god it’s me margaret” one summer i was 8 and completely traumatized when i realized it happens to my mom too i’m not helping here… my point being more students will now read these books than before banning them,negative
when one parent doesnt want their child to read a certain book they can fill out a form so no child in the school can read it that sounds more like indoctrination than education instead of removing the book from the whole school they should just disallow that one student access to the book sorry johnny you cant check out that book because your parents said so,negative

theres no accounting at his business irs are you listening how could this possibly be true,negative
yyyyyyeahh i dont buy the whole i didnt know bit re his lawyers sending two years of his texts to the plaintiffs lawyers his response was swift and appeared to me to be calculated im thinking especially since this is not the first time his lawyers have done this that they were hoping for mistrial or at least having the evidence removed from record as it includes all sorts of stuff anywho would you react as quickly as he did no pause no hesitation he was ready for that big reveal,neutral
so he’s still lying about his intention how much more could he possibly pay in light of the fact we know he’s still lying about this situation why do people follow him if they know he’s lying,negative
alex jones defense might actually be brilliant i didnt do it on purpose look at the lawyer he hired sent the prosecution all the evidence they needed i didnt do it on purpose he lied under oath i didnt do it on purpose i mean hes clearly guilty of torturing the victims of an elementary school shooting his choosen defense is the only option that had at least a 1 chance of working but ultimately him hiding his own money so he can declare bankruptcy defense is much stronger the old white man defense,negative

my test is on the 10th of next week this year hasn’t been the best for me and i have struggled with learning i’ll let you guys know if i have passed or not edit hi everyone i know i’m super late but long story short i passed this eoc review was definitely worth watching,positive
biology made ridiculously easy 1st edition digital book,positive
just started watching today everything seem so clear now looking forward to other videos,positive
thank you for helping beginners understand science god bless,positive
keep going guys you are doing an awesome job ,positive
very brief and interesting video i shall share it with my students look forward to watching more videos like this,positive
i like how this video is narrieted its more engaginggreat work,positive
awesome understanding explanation of biology ,positive
nice video can you let me know which tool did you use to make this great video thanks,positive
a virus interacts with its environment uses energy and reproduces but viruses are argued to be not living organisms maybe this is because they cant independently reproduce they require the cellular machinery of the host cell to manufacture new viruses,negative
love it i fell in love with all videos ,positive
if you liked the video and want to see more like this here are some things you can do to make sure it happens  share the video  check out nebula curiosity stream  like and comment,positive
having done a lot of diving i can say that the octopus is an absolute marvel to encounter some mostly the younger ones are so curious at first its like wow u threat once it establishes that you are not its like eeer what are you then ive never seen one of you around before and there begins the act of mutual curiosity 3 you slowly reach with a finger it sends a tentacle you both touch sometimes they get frightened and clamp your entire hand flashing black before letting go but not swimming away they are playful find a shiny pebble hand it to the octopus itll take it check if it can be eaten discard it then a few sec after send a tentacle back to the pebble out of curiosity as to why did he give me this pebble gotta check again for anything special they really hold a very special place in my heart its not everyday that two species get curious about one another and attempt mutual understanding,positive
i worked with a marine biologist studying cephalopods he had one big tank for octopuses and one for crabs their favorite food one morning he came in and found that one of his octopuses had pushed the lid open on his tank crossed the floor and climbed into the crab tank soon it became a common occurrence he decided to give the octopus a mild shock when he found it in the crab tank to deter it within days he came in and found the octopus had still gone to the crab tank eaten its fill but then climbed back to its own tank to avoid the shock they are amazing animals,neutral
my favorite creature ever i was on a crab ship in russia i was the green horn so i had to empty out the pots i was also making hooch quietly because it was forbidden it was lighting in a cup so i could swap liquor with the chef for him making me private meals one day there was an octopus in a crab pot i tossed it a live well came back once everyone was off the deck was gonna take it to the chef it softly wrapped itself around my arm and i felt like i could see the fear in its eyes i couldnt do it i took it over to the side of the ship held it over it looked down looked back at me let go of my arm and worked its way down the side of the ship until it got to the water amazing creatures,positive
i think cephalopod intelligence is “hard wired” an octopus has a very short lifespan as little as 18 months and has to learn everything from the moment it hatches completely on its own its mother died before it emerged from the egg so it is born an orphan this has huge implications because despite being intelligent it has no “mentor” to learn from it’s also a mollusk so in a way it’s a slug with awesome superpowers they’re fascinating animals,neutral
i can genuinely say i have never been more astounded by another being on this planet the evolution of this beautiful creature is literally out of this world this video left such an imprint on me that being able to pet play handle or be in close graces of this animal are on my lifes bucketlist for sure being apart of research and doing a 180 degree career change may be in my future,positive
i gotta go to work in 4hours and im over here learning about octopuses at 2 am,neutral
you know in our hunt for intelligent life in space its heartwarming and humbling to know there are other creatures on this planet other than humans who very well in the distant future could eventually be seen as a higher intelligence,positive
one of the most amazing species of octopus is the mimic octopus it not only uses its shape changing skin and camouflage to hide but also imitates other sea life both as a way to escape predators when being chased by a damselfish itll make itself look like a banded sea snake which is a damsel fish predator but also to hunt imitating a crab to draw in another crab the list of animals its been observed to imitate is quite long jelly fish lionfish sea snakes zebra sole flatfish giant crab sea horses ect it has also been recorded imitating at least two species we dont know about the same shape were recorded in separate locations being used by different individuals,positive
i feel that this is a great place to recommend the book children of ruin it depicts a society of octopuses that were subject to a virus which causes accelerated evolution and the struggle of humans to communicate with them some of the best scifi ive read,positive

the number of times ive heard we dont know and partially understood gives me hope for science,positive
this is amazing and really interesting i got so lost because i have insufficient scientific education to follow this completely but it is fascinating to me and i really enjoyed this video i have saved it and will play it over and over again to try and understand it i love the humor and the very clear way they are trying to explain this to the layman it is wonderful that they have this on youtube so we can all explore this amazing subject,positive
i just want to say that i absolutely love this im both mindblown entertained and inspired as a mere psych student i still feel like i understood a whole lot of it and they even made some psych references and the way they talked about children having an intuitive understanding of quantum stuff made me think of theorytheory and this quote its not that children are little scientists — its that scientists are big children,positive
this was a phenomenally moderated session serious kudos to john,positive
i am very thankful for this presentation i was afraid i was the only one that was pondering these ideas specifically concerning microbiology specifically the ability of bacterium changing their polarity quickly through chemical absorption of charged ions that are easily available through their outer cell wall causing that microbe to move in a since chemically that would explain the speed of its movement as if turning on and off a light in effect just by changing of polarity of a biome would move it through time and space while leaving its structure idle at its point of origin but alter the quality of a distant biome into the parents original quality in this accomplishing the quantum speeds said energy in itself could then be transferred into movement pressure fluctuation to force fluid movement or constriction as well as color change we see this in octopus or the movement of photophilic plant cells great discussion,positive
i just started enjoying watching this with closed captioning but 20 minutes in it stopped working i hope this can be fixed so i can watch the whole segment absolutely loved what was mentioned already so far thank you all for putting this together,positive
i wonder if some of these systems could be studied in the two organisms i know of that go into a frozen stasis during winter perhaps as the thaw begins to occur some of the bio quantum mechanical features could be observed and measured,neutral
thank you so much for this video very helpful for a biology teacher like me,positive
take note at 5200 the assertion is made that cellular biology especially how dna directs construction of its copy during mitosis is incredibly complex this should answer my critics who say im overstating the facts when i refer to dna as a 4d molecule it functions like a computer program or at least like a program controller within a cell,neutral
i remember being only able to see content like this on the discovery channel its crazy that i can watch content like this arguably waaay better at anytime and not being glued to my tv brilliant,positive
i use to be in the army i can remember in training the endless patrols through the woods but the dragonflies were our friends you’d see them gliding back and forth just over our heads catching the mosquitoes which swarmed around us it was impossible for the dragonflies to get all the mosquitoes but it was a comfort to know we had allies out there in those woods,positive
i once was kayaking with my father in florida when i took a break from rowing a beautiful dragonfly landed on the end of my ore about 12 seconds of me gawking at it went by before a bigger dragonfly landed on top of the first and proceeded to quickly rip its head off after it decapitated my new found friend it took off with the body leaving the head sitting on my ore with my jaw on the floor in total shock of what murder i had just witnessed that day i learned that dragon flies are metal as fuck,negative
that was probably one of the more intelligent clicks ive chosen in a while thank you for sharing and creating that incredible video now i absolutely have an even deeper appreciation for dragonflies than i already did ,positive
i once found a cold dragonfly who couldnt move i put it into diret sunlight and it warmed and flew away im glad to have been of help,positive
this was one of the best documentaries i’ve ever seen perfect organization perfect visuals extremely high information content… well done and thank you,positive
when i was growing up in the countryside in japan dragonflies were everywhere i could catch them with my fingers sometimes of course i let them go quickly but some of the kids put thread on them so they wouldnt fly away those were the days now i dont see many dragonflies anymore thank you so much for sharing the wonderful fact about them,positive
ive seen a dragon fly with 6 wings once i was floating down a river and it was flying near me and then landed on me for a short time all of the wings worked a cool mutation i wonder how rare it is wish i had a camera with me,positive
what intelligence to be able to skillfully control those beautiful wings about 22 years ago my husband and i stopped by a large creek to meditate as i opened my eyes a group of five dragonflies that were traveling over the water suddenly stopped in front of my face hovered there for about 10 seconds then suddenly did a 90 degree turn in synchronized fashion and continued on their way down the creek it was otherworldly i’ll never forget it thank you for this excellent content,positive

truly interesting to learn that sleep isnt restricted to organisms with a brain,positive
000 neuroscience the way we percieve the functions of the brain 331 botany the death flower 618 sleep new discoveries,neutral
quanta magazine always does a brilliant job at condensing scientific discoveries for a wider audience i love what you do,positive
i usually hold popsci in disdain but this series is an exception actually communicating the discoveries in a way that is suited to those who are scientifically literate but not experts in the field and not exaggeratingmystifying things for the sake of clickbait,neutral
regarding sleep and metabolism theres already good evidence of that being the case with various endocrine functions related to metabolism being affected by sleep disorders like sleep apnea and narcolepsy the functional systems model of the brain has also been an emerging conceptualization for a while now and loosely touches on the artificial distinction between neurology and psychiatry,neutral
i was waiting for this this blew my mind gotta wait for the physics and math one there are so much to tell great work,positive
i’ve been keeping my eyes on my subscriptions just in case quanta magazine posts this year’s science break through and it’s finally here great episode as usual i’m also excited for the maths and physics ones and thank you quanta magazine for your great work,positive

and if you haven’t had enough ocean creature facts for one day head over to listen to our new podcast episode “deciphering the mind of the octopus” on nebula it will take you behind the scenes on what it’s like to take care of these mischievous animals this is probably my favorite episode yet,positive
the existence of hammerhead sharks implies there exists a nail fish somewhere out there to be discovered,neutral
the most fearsome predator of the sea sharks the orca literally torturing other animals for fun am i a joke to you,negative
that footage of the finless shark plummeting to the sea floor was appalling im incredibly glad you showed it but its appalling im not outright against the killing of animals but the combination of outright cruelty and waste is just mind bending i struggle with how humans can so easily disconnect from certain realities i struggle with how i see it in myself as well a fisherman would know that these sharks would still be alive when theyre thrown back in if they just stopped to even think about what theyre doing if theyre hellbent on wasting the rest of the shark just slit the damn things throat before you throw it back you sick fuck,negative
it’s really interesting to think about how an animal that has been around for literally million of years just out of the blue made a species so different from the rest and out of the ordinary yet it ended up being very complex and enhanced from the norm,positive
awesome work love the video thank you for what you do,positive
sharks have survived all 5 mass extinctions prime suspects i would say,neutral
hammerheads are amazing years ago while trolling off the coast of florida i encountered one i was headed due south and we spotted it heading aproximately se fin out the surface big fella but we were on an intercept course he came to within 100 ft of the boat then turned off to the west he circled around well behind our baits and resumed his original course i swear he had gps,positive
your speech at the end of this video really struck me it makes me so happy to hear someone able to take their dream and make it a reality both your channel and real engineering are two of my favorites for interesting and niche technology and science and i am always excited to see a new video thank you for being you and sharing what you care about to the rest of the world,positive
the technical side of this video and this channel is truly impressive have to admit the fact they are providing free useful scientific information with such a great quality a very big thanks for the people behind this channel ,positive
check out even more from thor,positive
every time he answers its like hes telling us a story rather than regurgitating an answer i could listen to him all day,positive
give this guy his own animal documentary series like a more chill bill nye his explanations are like a little story and you dont make anyone feel bad about their questions bravo this was one of the most entertaining biology videos i have watched in awhile,positive
came for the biology facts stayed for his infectious positivity his energy alone is more of a dopamine hit than anything else has been all day,positive
how on earth does wired get the professionals who are literally the most passionate people on the planet,negative
he seems very passionate about biology the way that he explains these things makes it seem like he really loves his job i admire people who can be passionate about their jobs,positive
not only is he crazy passionate and knowledgeable about biology hes also called thor how much cooler can this guy get,positive
the plant is deadly deadly toxic d lmao i love this guy his enthusiasm is contagious keep bringing him back,positive
my favorite example of weird evolution is the aldabra rail a small flightless bird that lived on a single island and went extinct when the island sunk later when sea levels dropped its ancestor migrated back to the island and reevolved into the same species,neutral
he is the type of biology teacher that would be able to easily hold the attention of any classe just by the way he speaks so excited about things,positive
as someone obsessed with biology im pretty disappointed that the map of biology received the least views of all the sciences,negative
ive been waiting forever for this one although im biased by being a biochemist myself he did an amazing job at bringing all the branches together in a smooth nonconfusing way i would like to see a map of medicine or linguistics in the future,positive
awesome job with this maps and all the others too which will be the next map map of philosophy map of engineering map of psychology,positive
this is helping me understand what parts of biology i like and therefore helping me choose my education thank you for a very informational video,positive
the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell,neutral
i love your maps they are fantastic thank you for putting them together they are super helpful one nitpick what about microbiology this is a very important subject given that unicellular microorganisms vastly outnumber the multicellular organisms most people are familiar with of course i may be biased since i am a microbiologistanyway keep up the great work i am blown away by the breadth of your knowledge and have learned a ton about scientific fields i am less familiar with through your work,positive
love the kurzgesagt reference at 302 can you do the map of astronomy next,positive
i love these maps so much they are pure gold philosophy i imagine is very tough to make but would be extremly awesome too,positive
you mentioned that bioinformatics is the field that uses computers to analyze genetic data when statistical methods arent enough but when statistical methods are enough that is a field called quantitative genetics and using it we can often tell whether a trait is genetic without having to know which specific genes are involved it can also help give candidates for molecular genetic study to find the genes relating to those traits,neutral
these videos are good but i have two minor criticisms of this one 1 structural biology is concerned with the structure of large macromolecules amino acids are all small molecules so they fall more under the purview of biochemistry your description is almost verbatim one of the sentences from the opening paragraph of the wikipedia page on structural biology but i dont think thats correct 2 biomedical engineering is the field that makes artificial organs and other medical devices biotechnology uses living organisms or their products for our purposes synthetic biology creates synthetic organisms and is closely related to biotechnology but the latter two fields arent closely related to the first,negative

i started teaching biology in 1993 and i know my kids now middle aged know it was rosalind franklin who did the work hank thank you i left teaching but am thinking about getting back into the classroom using your videos to study up for the test to get recertified,positive
thank you so much for covering rosalind franklin some of my previous instructors only briefly mention her and they rarely discuss her major contributions to the discovery of the dna structure,positive
the funny part about biology is that everyone pronounces everything differently,neutral
why is a teenage boy similar to helicase they both want to unzip your genes grins im speechless,negative
i dont remember crash course being this complicated when i was in 9th grade biology though i guess i should be thankful that 6 years later it is still helpful for my college level genetics class,positive
editing team hank please hold up a shoelace and be amazed by it,positive
for the first time in my two years in college i actually understand what i am seeing thank you i am in the mlt program trying to understand how pcr testing works but in order to do that i realized that i really need to comprehend dna and how it is made in order to understand how it is taken apart and analyzed you have really given me a strong visual and i cant thank you enough,positive
lectures hit different when you’re not pressured by grades,neutral
honestly its crazy how much easier information is retained when you voluntarily seek it when i was in school i would have never listened to this and would have been dying to get out of there now that i have the ability to learn on my own time i retain and look for information on a much higher level incredible,positive
this professor is wonderful i’ve been in a lot of lectures and the way he immediately captured my attention held it injected humor and made me like him was fantastic intro to human behavior indeed,positive

the fact that we can access this lecture without having to attend stanford is mindblowing what a time to be alive,positive
im literally in middle school yet im able to follow this to an extent really makes it obvious that this professors great at his job,positive
im so grateful for living in an era where this kind of content is available like this im from brazil and i wouldnt be able to listen to this amazing classes if stanford and professor sapolsky werent so kind to make it available online thank you,positive
coming back on that lecture youre an absolute gem robert sapolsky ive discovered this video a year ago searched my way through the infite possibilities of life finally started my bachelor in psychology and i head on becoming a researcher in evolutionary psychology or something like that if things go well and if i still like it hopefully i see you some day at stanford university,positive
this is an absolutely amazing lecture because he doesnt just dive into the subject he outlines the way to approach it without thinking in boxes its a refresher for scientific and critical thinking abilities designed to help unravel a very complex and challenging subject i think im going to be spending some quality hours here with the dr one of his lectures on koko the gorilla brought me to this playlist,positive
the fact that baby orcas have to learn their language shows how intelligent these beings are,positive
the fact that whalesdolphins can legally just be kept at places like seaworld is just insane given just the information in this video,negative
2150 its really fascinating to see the orcas movements in front of the mirror they move with this careful consideration and grace that you also see in species like the dolphin or gorilla or humans for that matters,positive
when i was a kid i was a given a plush orca that immediately became my best friend it wasnt until years later that i found out that orcas are actually fearsome beasts that sat at the top of the oceans food chain and honestly i just fell in love with them even more,positive
one of the coolest things to me about orcas that the video doesn’t mention is that there has never been a recorded human death from a wild orca but orcas have been recorded and seen leading humans towards pods of whales to hunt they might see humans as a potential symbiotic relationship since they’re known to eat human leftovers from whaling or snag stray fish when fishermen use nets just super cool that they easily could attack and kill humans but seemingly have no interest in doing so,positive
the lummi nation refer to the local orcas as qwe lhol mechen which means our relatives who live under the sea or the people under the waves orcas live in tightknit families in most cases both males and females stay in their natal pod throughout their entire lives this is especially true for southern and northern residents orcas are incredibly intelligent and social their limbic system the part of the brain that processes emotion is incredibly developed and complex each pod uses a distinctive dialect to communicate theyre the only species besides humans pilot whales beluga whales and narwhals that go through menopause famous southern resident orcas fish eaters lolita granny ocean sun tahlequah who made worldwide headlines when she was spotted carrying her dead calf for 17 days moby doll shamu luna theres a documentary about luna called the whale famous northern resident orcas fish eaters namu corky tsitika eve sharky top notch springer the only orca to have been successfully reintegrated back into the wild famous transient orcas mammaleaters lonesome george fatfin chainsaw esperanza sidney and her children raksha and her five daughters,positive
i remember watching black fish and hearing one of the sailors sent to capture the first set of orca calves remark about how when getting the calves in the boats the vocalizations they heard made them realize they were taking a baby and that its family was crying because of it really unnerving information for a college student aiming to become a scientist,negative
orcas really are the humans of the sea theyre everywhere eat anything work in groups have dialects pass down skills over generations and have great teamwork skills if they were humans i would say they are in a sort of tribal stage its only a matter of time before they become advanced one way or another,positive
i love that seafaring mammals evolved out of the ocean were unimpressed with the land and just went back,positive
what a dream it would be to be able to actually communicate to orcas at some point communicating with other intelligent species is so huge,positive

expand to see important notes for this video 1 this video as stated in the description focuses on general functions of biomolecules the biomolecules carbs lipids proteins and nucleic acids can all can have important functions in the body this is a video about the general function of biomolecules for your dietary needs consult with a dietitian or medical doctor 2 we mention the popular cho cho chon chonp mnemonic for major elements in the biomolecules as we mention these are basics there can be more elements such as sulfur for example in proteins but we wanted to identify common elements starting at the building block level at the building block level some amino acids lack sulfur for example its not just sulfur for example there are lipids that can additionally contain phosphate or nitrogen the popular cho cho chon chonp mnemonic sticks with basic elements found even at the building block level 3 since this video only uses one character for carbohydrates one character for lipids and one character for proteins unfortunately when mentioning general functions of each biomolecule type it isnt designed to show a specific type we received a great point in an email though that since our little lipid character is a triglyceride this can be confusing when naming lipid functions for example at 352 in the video when saying lipids are part of the cell membrane it would be much better if we do not show the little lipid character so there wont be any confusion as we do not want to imply that specific lipid type makes up the cell membrane phospholipids are a major lipid type in the cell membrane although other types exist as well we plan to explore creating individual detailed videos on lipids carbs and proteins where we can show different types update we have videos dubbed in spanish and portuguese using an artificial voice via to increase accessibility see our amoeba sisters en español channel and amoeba sisters em português want to help translate our subtitles in any language learn more here,neutral

the part about the mutated dna is insane during the process of evolution some of these plants basically repurposed and readjusted their basic plant toolkit for a drastically different purpose the fundamental working remains similar clearly establishing a link to the original version yet the execution and result are completely new,neutral
what i find most interesting of all of this is how the underlying mechanisms for carnivory are rootedpun intendedin the genomes of many plants since theyre usually used for defense against pathogens and herbivorous insects with how common knowledge carnivorous plants are it really surprises me that they arent used as examples of how evolution works with what it has also makes one realise how plants are very much alive and aware of the world surrounding them,positive
loved this video i have always found carnivorous plants fascinating had had several venus flytraps but i didn´t know how they actually worked or evolved thank you for the video,positive
yes an “insane biology of” carnivorous plants i’m an amateur cps grower on my free time and a fan of the channel it’s the perfect combination though on 138 aren’t waterwheels’ aldrovanda traps also snap traps i believe bladderworts utricularia are the ones with suction traps,positive

2 more facts about the platypuses • they used to be giants the ancient versions of a lot of modern animals including penguins were oversized monsters compared to the animals we know today—and platypuses are no different in 2013 the discovery of a single tooth helped researchers identify a prehistoric platypus that was more than three feet long—double the size of the modern animal • they lack a stomach platypuses platypodes and platypi are technically also correct but much rarer in use arent the only animals to forgo an acidproducing part of the gut spiny echidnas and nearly a quarter of living fishes all have a gullet that connects directly to their intestines good day,neutral
please give us as many “the insane biology of” videos as possible,neutral
theres a lot more unusual stuff under the hood of these guys and their echidna cousins their skeletons for example have epipubic bones aka pouch bones which are only found in marsupials and monotremes but more unusual still they have 3 bones in their pectoral girdle while all other mammals have only two on a human for example the pectoral girdle aka the bones that link the arms to the rest of the skeleton and make up the shoulder is made of two bones the scapula shoulder blade and clavicle collar bone with one running to the back and the other linking up at a socket in the sternum it means that we like all mammals can pivot our shoulders around not just the arms within the socket compare this to birdsreptiles and older tetrapod groups and youll find that the pectoral girdle is a fused mass just like the pelvic girdle with two bones at the front that firmly anchor the shoulders in place to the sternum this third bone is the coracoid bone and mammals lost it a long time ago except in monotremes on the plus though like the rigid flight frame of a bird it provides a very solid anchor for powerful forelimbs which is why platypus primarily use their forelimbs to swim or echidna to dig splayed legs more ribs than other mammals low body heat eggs venom etc honestly make platypus and echidna more like lizards in a furry costume than just a beaver with a duck bill or a pointynosed hedgehog,neutral

first there was a world ruled by birds and now a world ruled by frogs whats next cats snakes elephants the possibilities are truly endless in speculative evolution,neutral
i love speculative biology but this project has one problem as i see it the idea is presented that these amphibians wouldnt transition to forms of exothermic metabolism we have evidence that both crocodilians and dinosaurs could change from warmblooded to coldblooded and back again birds being warmblooded reptiles show the transition from ectothermic to exothermic lifestyles why wouldnt amphibians do the same over the eons in one shape or another,neutral

has there ever been any speculative evolution of the octopus i would very much like to see that since there have already been xenobiologists who have described the rise of octopus since they have massive amounts of neurons eg throughout the animal including each leg which has the ability to feel taste and smell it is known that they have a great degree of intelligence from using that different type of brain they already have their own video channels such as octolab etc but i remember someone showing drawings of octos swinging through trees id dearly love to see these creatures advance thru the eons,positive
an animal evolving a foamlike cover instead of fur is such an interesting and original concept goddamn now imagine if those foam glands slowly made the foam more firm over millions of years the glands adapt eventually the foam glands evolve into something similar to hair follicles that produce very soft bulbs of keratin we now have frog sheep made of cloud bubbles this sounds like such an adorable fairy tale but also oddly possible in real life,positive
i’m sorry but i laughed every time you said “greater moist boy” every time this was another great speculative world and i liked that it was an alternate history of our own planet the last few videos have taken us to some truly insane alien worlds which i have loved but it always feels nice to come back home and speculate about our own pale blue dot and all the ways it could have turned out differently i love your channel so much,positive
there were several things that were not taken into account when evolving over time they stuck way too closely to frog morphology and tried to hammerfit it into each of the niches amphibians have varied morphology now that were advantageous for land dwelling amphibians but were not mentioned amphibians that become completely terrestrial without need for water as part of their life cycle no longer meet the definition of amphibian every evolved amphibian retained frog eyes and body structure evolution is also influenced by things never mentioned as well predator prey relationships drive evolution fast running prey animals and predictors are an example size also dictates evolution due to environmental factors amphibians respiratory system is a limiting factor as many dont have lungs and breathe by uptake of oxygen through the skin or primitive lungs this limits size the larger the animal the more oxygen is needed thats why lungs evolved this would also change mouth and nose shape,neutral
the speculative world ruled by decapods such as crabs lobsters hermit crabs and shrimp seems interesting considering how diverse they are,positive
one thing about the inhabitated lodge given its a desert animal i think it would make more sense if its tadpoles inhabit its back a protected reservoir seems tl be good for tadpoles in a water poor enviroment and given how beecomb frogs already carry their eggstadpoles in chambers of there belly this would feel like a nice nod to this real animal in addition this could be a way to get mammalian or placentalian amphibians of sorts if it would continue to evolve along this line,positive
i love these what if speculative documentaries i love the ideas of what if some animals were the dominant species friggin love the moist bois and the freeple my favorite idea is a cephalopod world in the game splatoon the lore is people died to a massive war and sea life took hold its kinda hinted their evolution was rapid due to either radiation science gone wrong or the lack of mammalian predators so i wonder what a squid or octo world would be like would both evolve simultaneously like the inklings and octolings did would civilization rise again i dunno i wonder what a realistic splatoon world would be where sealife specifically invertebrates evolved,positive

trying to test out of bio 101 so i can eventually get my third degree nursing thanx hank along with that here is what i quickly typed down as a sort of summary feel free to fix  william prout discovered our stomachs have hydrochloric acid and discovered chemical composition of urea also discovered food is divided into carbs fats and proteins  carbohydrates are the source of all energy  carbs are made of sugars with the simplest being monosaccharides  glucose a monosaccharide number 1 sugar that comes from the sun  fructose same chemical as glucose but arranged differently and is sweeter  disaccharides are two monosaccharides put together  sucrose fructose and glucose connected is a disaccharide joined by a covalent bond  polysaccharides are thousands of simple sugar units  cellulose is a bunch of glucose molecules  bread is made of starch and amylase  our bodies store carbs in form of glycogen in our muscle until we need to use them  we store our energy long term through fat aka lipids  lipids are non polar and can’t dissolve in water  fats are made of glycerol and fatty acids  saturated fats don’t have double bonds while unsaturated fats do  trans fat do not exist in nature and are unsaturated and bad for the body  omega 3 fats unsaturated are essential but we need to eat them in order to get them  phospholipids form cell membrane walls to keep bad stuff out and good stuff in  phospholipids are one end polar and one end non polar  steroids a phospholipid made of 4 carbon rings are used to make cholesterol  proteins of made of 20 amino acids which do everything for the body  nitrogen can only be gotten into our bodies from food via foods high in protein  polypeptides are formed by long chains of amino acids  the 9 essential amino acids which are bodies can’t make on their own are histidine isoleucine leucine lysine methionine phenylalanine threonine tryptophan and valine,neutral

i failed biology 3 times already this is my 4th time taking the class first time actually trying to seriously understand it i’ve been watching your videos that relate to what we’re learning in class i want to thank you for helping me earn a 92 on my first exam i’m so grateful for you,positive
could you imagine if a bunch of aliens dropped 2 super predators on a city just to see how the humans adapt to it,neutral

im from brazil and i heard ranchers telling stories such as about that time their grandpa saw a harpy lifting a newborn calf duting his youth or that day a harpy snatched a hound in goiás clearly exagerations wild tales but it shows the reverence respect and even fear the harpy commands on people also the state police here where im from has harpia as a callsign their helicopters,negative
i wonder if the harpy calls werent only used to identify primates without a response but to actually wear down their awareness overtime by conditioning them to expect calls before seeing the eagle we might see more of those mixups and mindgames if we observed them in areas where primates lived alongside eagles for more than a year,negative
ive been a fan of harpys for years now but this video blew my mind the amount of intelligence gathered by the eagles during the bci experiment is huge birds are truly in the same conversation as mammals in terms of ingenuity,positive

since the animations are kinda confusing the numbers up i recapped the transformation here glycolysis glucose 2 atp 2 pyruvates energy this energy is used for making 4 atp net profit of 2 atp and 2 nadh from 2 adp 2 nad and 2 hydrogen probably h fermentation pyruvate energy lactic acid krebs cycle 2 pyruvates 2 o₂ 2 acetyl coenzyme a 2 co₂ energy this energy is used to form 2 nadh from nad and hydrogen 2 acetyl coenzyme a 2 oxaloacetic acid 2 citric acid 2 citric acid 4 o₂ 2 oxaloacetic acid energy 4 co₂ this energy is used to make 2 atp 6 nadh and 2 fadh₂ so after the krebs cycle we now have 10 nadh 2 fadh₂ and 4 atp or 6 if you count the atp spent in glycolysis electron transport chain 10 nadh energy 10 nad 10 hydrogen this energy is used to pump some protons out of the inner membrane of the mitochondria they went back through the atp synthase creating at most 3 atp for each nadh for a total of 30 atp at most 2 fadh₂ energy 2 fad 4 hydrogen this energy is also used to pump some protons this creates at most 2 atp each fadh₂ for a total of 4 atp conclusion total atp created 38 molecules if the cell is very efficient 2 atp is spent in glycolysis so there would be at most 40 atp that went through the steps 10 nad were used and probably reused 2 fad were used and also probably reused 6 o₂ were used and they became 6 co₂ in the krebs cycle 2 oxaloacetic acid were used and reused hope this helps,neutral

2530 i did pretty good ,positive
it refreshed my knowledge thank you,positive
very interesting quizzes,positive
these speculative biologies are always fun to watch always makes you wonder what really is out there,positive
dumb idea a ca video thats literally just exploring life on earth describing the lifeforms with examples from fictional works in a role reversal way treating the very real animals like their pieces of speculative work and vice versa ie in the vast earth oceans live an apex predator unchanged for millions of years the shark though they look remarkably simular to the squidsharks of 4546b but are more closely related to earth fish than squids as a terrible example,negative
i really like these speculative alien lifeforms better than many weve seen on here i think its bc they feel aesthetically natural like they are unlike most earth organisms but feel like they still obey the constraints of biophysics,positive
my son used to love drawing his own speculative alien worlds from single cells to highly evolved he never ceased to amaze me with how rich and diverse he populated them i stumbled across awesome videos like this one and learned what he had done is a whole thing i share these with him and hope they spark his imagination as much as he does my own thank you for sharing these with us edit thank you for your patience if you still would like to see his old drawings its a busy time of year but well get the track down and posted on my little channel soon,positive
another wellmade video about speculative biology keep it up sir,positive
this is one of the most fleshed out speculative biologies ive seen in this channel so far the illustrations are high quality and the little interactions between these organisms in their alien ecosystem can be derived from the illustrations themselves and its really interesting,positive
something ive noticed about alien spec bio things is that i dont often see structures analogous to fur or feathers on the critters i wonder why,negative
i love that this had very distinct biomes and body plans from each other they all looked like they’d evolved together but really varied in color size and overall form it also allowed for much more realistic looking while still bloody great and weird scenes idk i really liked this one it was cool and kinda realistic in a weird way,positive
i would suggest checking out the anime made in the abyss for a potential episode the fictional creatures in the work are downright awe inspiring as they are bizarre,positive
one area of speculative are the predictions of life on the planets of our solar system as you may have seen in lemminos recent video people have proposed ideas for life on the moon mars venus etc for hundreds of years as well as modern day in that same sense videos surrounding the biology of aliens visiting earth ie usually as invaders would be interesting,neutral

thanks to cameraman live from million years ago for the documentary,positive
its amazing that the skulls remain in the soil for millions of years for us to do such detailed scientific researches on without them we never knew what they looked like or how they evolved fossils really are precious legacy of our ancestors,positive
its truly mindblowing to know how far weve come and how weve become the dominant species on earth in such a short amount of time considering how advanced weve become technologically it seems almost impossible to think that we are also animals evolution is truly amazing,positive
ill never forget visiting the natural history section of the smithsonian institute as a kid with my parents back in the 60s im 69 now btw they had an exhibit there that would blow your mind it consisted of a wall depicting human evolution where they had probably a hundred or so skulls in rows against a dark backdrop i assume so the images would stand out better it led the viewer visually from humans earliest known ancestors with authentic fossil skulls from the most primitive eg australopithicus all the way to modern man homo sapiens it was quite impressive and left the viewer with no doubt about human evolution there it was in terms of a tangible fossil record expertly organized right before the viewers eyes ,positive
wow i would love an hour long video with who ever made this that was so informative and to the point thank you,positive

some people still ask why are there still apes or monkeys it should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes and from that due to their lack of education they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans that is not how evolution works but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology they might just as well have asked if dogs are descended from wolves why are there still wolves or even if americans came from europe why are there still europeans just as dogs descended from a population of wolves so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes what we know is that the first apes evolved in africa about 25 million years ago from a population of old world monkeys whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the tops of branches apes evolved the ability to swing arm over arm from branch to branch evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment for apes that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it at one time there were about 30 different species of apes in those forests had environmental conditions remained the same we would still see forests covering the whole african continent however conditions did not stay the same the climate became drier as a result forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands the african savanna with just a few scattered trees the shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct then about 6 or 7 million years ago one population of apes split with some of them opting for life on that open savanna all apes are capable of walking upright they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly that savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity by about 4 mya our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis femur knees and feet as modern humans that gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel they did however retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened the apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change they became the ancestors of todays chimps and bonobos those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them it set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us,negative

my opinion was always that wyverns are a typesubspecies of dragon saying thats not a dragon thats a wyvern is about as useful as saying thats not a dog thats a border collie,neutral
if hippos were carnivores that lit their prey on fire so all the nightmares at once,negative
i like how the true dragons didnt end up looking like the stereotypical dragon instead they had a very quetzalcoatl appearance which makes it believable as cool as a dragon looking like draco from dragonheart would be i could see a pterosaurlike dragon being more realistic,positive
have you ever heard of the 1982 animated movie “a flight of dragons” they answer a lot of dragon biology questions like the fact that dragons can fly because they are essentially organic hydrogen balloons and they breathe fire to vent it off,neutral
i remember a highschool biology project in which we had to create a basic phylogeny graph for dragons including drawings it was very fun,positive
i’m surprised there isn’t more dragons with names taken directly from mythical dragons i could absolutely see orochi gorynych lindwurms basilisks serrushes leviathan behemoth ziz python ladon and even to an extent typhon fitting in well to this family tree,positive
i’d love this as a video game create a skyrimesque world except where dragons aren’t mythical creatures but wild animals that could have adequate intelligence and small levels of society like a smart dolphin i think the approach would be cool bc it could be a mechanism for keeping humans in a medieval age since dragons would prey on cities like wolves on sheep,positive
i actually pondered on how dragons would be able to breath fire and i brought the topic up to my mom i had the idea that they had to have an organ in their body that would produce a highly reactive gas or liquid and that when it was forced out it would either ignite from the oxygen or something else would ignite it internally which is where my mom got the idea that dragons would have a crop like chickens have and throughout a dragons lifetime they would eat rocks of flint that would go into that crop when the dragon needed to breath fire that crop would constrict extremely fast while the gasliquid came up igniting and sending out flames the dragons internals being protecting by a thick flame retardant mucus,neutral
since we did dragons and horse paleontology is so rarely touched on a unicorn or other myth creature could be another cool video,positive
until a few years ago i didnt even know about the dragon wyvern debate ive always thought and still do all wyverns are dragons not every dragon is a wyvern just like every duck is a bird but not every bird is a duck dragon is just a broad term for many different creatures the one with four legs and two wings are european dragons just my way of thinking not saying it as a factnot sure what most peoples opinion is,neutral
a summary video two water  h2o uses a covalent bond each hydrogen shares an electron with oxygen it is thus a polar molecule  all water molecules are attracted to each other due to this polarity – these are hydrogen bonds between the positive and negative poles of different molecules  hydrogen bonds in water results in high cohesion and thus high surface tension  cohesion is the attraction between two like things eg two water molecules  water has the highest cohesion of any nonmetallic liquid  adhesion is the attraction between two unlike things eg water and glass  capillary action is water defying gravity  water is the greatest solvents due to its polarity  hydrophilic molecules are polar – their polarity is stronger than the cohesive forces of water  hydrophobic molecules cannot break the cohesive forces of water because they are nonpolar  solid water is less dense than liquid water due to hydrogen bonds forming crystalline structures that space molecules apart more easily when frozen  water has a very high heat capacity – it is good at holding on to heat thus oceans regulate climate and temperature of planets,positive
im an accounting student but i had a horrible chemistry teacher in high school and im taking this courses solely to have a better understanding of the world around me and all i wanted to say was that theyve been really helpful in making me understand with a little extra reasearch all the basics of chemistry thank you crashcourse,positive

so around 32 degrees fahrenheit or 0 degree celsius if youre a scientist or from a part of the world where things make sense im dying here,neutral
to summarize this video h2o is a covalent bond hydrogen bonds stick together hydrogen bonds are weak cohesion is the attraction between two like things water has the highest cohesion of any nonmetallic liquid adhesion is the act of water spreading out adhesion is the attraction between two unlike things capillary action is water defying gravity water is a polar molecule water is a solvent the greatest,neutral

i credit crash course with my success in bio105 when you cover 2 chapters a week and youre taking 15 credit hours4 classes total its pretty much hilariously impossible to actually grasp the material as you progress and really understand it,negative
im at a point where i watch your videos for fun you make learning so easy and fun thank you so much,positive
the best part about his style of teaching is the storyline and narrative visuals he doesn’t just point out and explain he makes you understand the whole biological process regardless how abstract the concept is he paints a picture that you will remember and that in itself is a true talent ,positive

this is literally an entire semester of a 400level evolutionary developmental biology course summed up in a 5 minute song fucking legendary,negative
biology aside someone has to mention how absolutely insane this acapella is musically he is not using any external instruments apart from his damn mouth absolutely incredible,negative
i still get shivvers from how good this is 3 years later,positive
this is a masterpiece and must be protected for future generations,positive
this song is fuckin legendary its been 4 years and i still cant get it to stop playing in my mind at totally random times i sometimes shout signal signal or hum random parts of the song while reading this song is like the genetic code itself tightly packed with the entire summary of evolutionary and developmental biology in a few minutes i was starting out with embryology when this song came out and this made me understand the genetic regulation part so well still waiting for some more amazing songs like this one this is still my favorite though it was my ringtone for a year,positive
this is such a great song i can’t imagine the amount of effort put into this video i remember watching this at school two years ago my science teacher would randomly play your videos in class sometimes this deserves so much more attention love the content on here keep going,positive
this is so incredible the fact that he can put all these talents into one the singing the acappella the scientific knowledge the brilliantly clever song writing literally amazing,positive

why recreate adversity im definitely part of that subgroup against bonsai its crippling trees for just aesthetics and theres also some weird control issues to unpack around it just get some plants that are good for your local wildlife,negative
people like to talk about torturing trees like they dont cut their grass every week,negative
i like the part that bonsai tree can grow big if allowed and can still make fruitseed so we could theoretically save endangered giant trees by making bonsais of them and have a hope that one day there will be place where they can their offspring can grow big again,positive
there are also natural bonsai they form in small pockets of soil on certain rock formations and are really rare,neutral
so a bonsai could theoretically become a normal huge tree when planted elsewhere but the question is is a tree “happier” when it grows way bigger or is the tree happy when it’s small too the obvious answer is no the tree doesn’t care another answer would be “we have no way of knowing” people like to assign emotions to things but a lot of the time those emotions are just selfreflection people assign the wrong emotions to animals too even though we know animals can feel emotion people still misunderstand them and describe them incorrectly this happens all the time so even when we find out trees can experience emotion and some evidence already suggests this we would probably still force our own perspective onto them like we do now what we do know for a fact is that plants do what they do with the conditions they are given are they “satisfied” being the tree that they are i don’t think trees know this concept i think people shouldn’t anthromorphise their idea of “succes and satisfaction” onto plants in fact people already project their ideas of success onto other people and animals who don’t need it the trees definitely don’t need it either,negative
trees never ask for a lighter burden only for broader shoulders now thats an inspirational quote,positive
to the people saying that growing bonsais is torture i just want to say that many of the training methods are also applies in other tree nurseries where the trees for parks streets and gardens are grown they are repotted pruned the roots too wired and they get limited amounts of nutrients in order to grow into the desired shape of course it isnt neccessary to keep bonsais at such a small size when the trees could become much bigger but as long as they are kept healthy i dont see a problem with it i think that few wild trees actually have the resources to grow to their full potential and especially not the ones that grow in urban settings,neutral
bonzai shows that life can be beautiful within the struggle im having rough times lately feels like giving up at times this quote really cheers me up,positive
theres no way you could assume that its doing actual harm to the tree after all you reassure the plant has got all it needs to survive and actually flourish on a smaller scale since youre eliminating the constant struggle for survival that happens in nature,neutral
bonsai are also easier to store than a fully grown tree so it playes a part in preservation you could have a full metal rack of 20 bonsai but not a single full tree would fit there,neutral
dear hank thank you for teaching my ap bio class because you do one hell of a lot better job than my teacher,positive

hank great video as always one question you seemed to make a point of mentioning more than once that protists are unicellular yet i was under the impression that protists being the grey area they are as you mentioned include all eukaryotes that are considered neither animalia plantae nor fungi i was also under the impression that some of these protista are indeed multicellular kevin,positive
thanks for making these interesting videos i have a question what about viruses do they also go into the same system or are they outside it,positive
reading bill bryson’a a short history of nearly everything had to pull out my microbiology with taxonomy textbook thank you for your detailed presentations they are helping immensely with understanding this tip of the iceberg,positive
thank you hank for acknowledging the constant change in our understanding of the world it amazes me that even just 5 years after this video went up the taxonomic system has changed so much that my college biology of organisms course has to teach an entirely new classification science has made a victory in the description of supergroups and the integration of the meltingpot that was kingdom protista into groups which better fit their traits and evolution just as you hinted might be a good idea,positive
hi i love crash course been using it since 3rd grade and now in 7th and still using it this is my first year in a middle school where we do midterms and crash course has helped me prepare for history physics biology and chemistry so thank you so much for the videos and plz make one for the 4 macromolecules of life and 6 characteristics of life thank you,positive

i am so unbelievably happy ans i havent even watched part ii i mean i know how it ends maybe i graduated in it but this is how you should teach physics to students this is entertaining its simple but extremely detailed and understandable at all levels you wont get a class of teens looking at you like youre reciting the bible in latin backwards and then an average c score at the end this is what physics is fun endless thinking endless possibilities endless learning physics is the language of existence and we are just toddlers slowly navigating our ways through learning the abcs of it at any given point in time this is life teaching us theres nothing better than this nothing yeh,positive
for those that want more in depth information on some of the subjects i talked about in this video here are some detailed videos i made 1 newtons law of universal gravitation 2 entropy 3 electromagnetism and the speed of light 4 special relativity 5 einsteins general relativity 6 quantum mechanics basics 7 extra credit 4 fundamental forces of nature,neutral
well if your going to teach physics you gotta start from the beginning it’s a warm summer evening in ancient greece,neutral
physics is not about remembering physics is about concept walter lewin,neutral
duuuuude for years and years i never understood why time slows down when you move faster your diagram with the two flashlight beams completely cleared it up subscribed,neutral
im late to this party but i wanted to let you know that your explanation of relativity and the graphic of the two trains has helped more of my physics students than any thing else i have come across simple elegant and accessible thanks for the great videos,positive
i like how he explains the speed of light at the speed of light,positive
this is exceptionally explained i was also a student of physics and can somewhat understand the complexities involved i only wish that he should have taken half an hour instead of 15 minutes hats off to you sir and thanks,positive
really a video worth watching whenever i feel really negative about physics being attacked always by the odds in classrooms and exams this video heals me though i watch i cant understand all of themhope to understand in the near future,positive
your explanatory description for the general relativity theory is phenomenal it solved a long time confusion for me thank you,positive
i never truly understood the difference between weight and mass until i heard your explanation thank you,positive
time crystals have got to be one of the coolest scientific names given to an object,positive
i love how the scientist explained what 37 sigma represents in a coin toss its much more easy to understand and i think if he didnt i would certainly be confused its always great to translate these discoveries into something more people can reach,positive
its so awesome that they managed to find a way to legitimately call something a time crystal,positive
quanta first video i watch of yours and i gotta say im very impressed 1 you dumb down sophisticated subjects adequately like not condensending and not too high level props to your script writer this is not easy so gj 2 your community is respectful and curious and i thoroughly enjoy this corner of the internet im going to check out a couple more of your vids and if its the same story you earned yourself a sub thank you and keep it up,positive
time crystal just doesnt consume energy like any atom for example perpetual motion machine generates energy from nothing the idea of the time crystal is not that its perpetual motion machine or breaks some physics law but that this is periodic motion without losing energy we knew the possibility of such motion with super fluids and other exotic states for a while but this is the first legit exactly zero energy loss demonstration,neutral
this is beautiful this video implicitly tells you that how science works science doesn’t always comprise of eureka moments often scientists slog through different inconsistencies assumptions and opposing theories to purport a hypothesis,positive
its amazing to see how much we still have to learn,positive
thanks for creating this site although i am a retired physicist it is exciting to read about what discoveries are being made particularly in quantum world,positive
thank you so much quanta magazine to fill young hearts with this deep inquisitiveness and fascination with the reality around the true potential of the platform is limitless this epic summary just resonates so many unexplained questions than i had the time before,positive
people overlook physics too much this is where the cool stuff comes from,positive
math also called the language of physics so in fact i think the real reason for me to learn physics is its concepts,neutral
you speak so fluidly like a natural cant wait to see what is in store for the future of your channel,positive
thank you i am writing a book and i needed some basic instruction on physics i look forward to more of your lessons,positive
in the first 20 seconds ive learned something important thank you you are a wise teacher i am grateful for the opportunity to learn,positive
no one chemist ill just throw acid on a gas vehicle,negative
this channel helped me get an a in physics 7your time is truly worth it for these videos,positive
i will be taking physics in my sophomore year next year and i really like this video now i can somewhat expect the things i would have to interpret next year,positive
i used to think that complicated math is useless but im starting to get the point now thank you,neutral
good video but small trifle at around 044 friction should be pointing to the left since friction always opposes the direction of motion of an object in contact with another object,neutral
thank you very much for a simple intro to a described complex subject i look forward to watching more of your videos so i can understand this unique language of physics,positive
heisenberg also wrote what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning,neutral
this is the kind of physics i understand it makes sense that physics is a model of our perception of the world and not the world itself the map is not the territory,neutral
as a programmer this was the most intuitively understandable episode in 7 years of pbs spacetime,positive
cant help but quote douglas adams there is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable there is another theory which states that this has already happened”,negative
everyone is always asking what is physics no one is ever asking how is physics doing,neutral
is it possible that the reason why we cant answer the two questions are you a particle at the same time as are you a wave is because we are not asking the question correctly perhaps when we find the singular question that captures both of those questions we will understand that it isnt a duality but something else,neutral
sending the electron through a magnetic field doesnt seem like asking are you spin up or down but rather will you orient yourself up or down when subjected to this field and it seems logical that the leftright alignment would be random after that since then youre asking will you orient yourself left of right when subjected to this orthogonal field anyway taking this sort of observer centric view probably often leads one to boltzmann brains and other rather useless hypersimplified things,negative
nice to see that kants take on epistemology that our knowledge of reality can be defined only as phenomenal or relating to our experiences senses and how our mind organizes information as opposed to noumenal or relating to fundamentally direct knowledge about reality itself still seems to be floating on gracefully for anything dealing with the actual nature of reality time to visit your local metaphysician unfortunately any statement from a metaphysician can only really be speculation and language games so alas,neutral
this episode was such a pay off for those of us who have been on this journey of discovery with space time from the beginning it feels like season finale of the 8th season of a show where it basically explains that everything you thought was important was actually meaningless and that the acceptance of this fact is actually the point,positive
what this all suggests to me is that the physical reality behind quantum mechanics is explicitly nonlocal eg bohmian mechanics and it is the process of gathering information about a system that imposes locality that is gathering information is an inherently local process,neutral
a literal genius asking what is omg is exactly the situation i needed to see,positive
i used to see this guy on every space and universe documentary in the 2000s glad hes still going full swing,positive
he is so genius that even the omg was beyond for his learning,positive
was einstein wrong with theory of relativity michio yes and no spoken like a true quantum physicist,neutral
i just cant get my head around about how insanely lucky we are to have such amazing people talking to us through the internet i know this video is a bit older so who cares but that was a thought that constantly went through my head while watching this,positive
this dude has the most stereotypical scientist hair and i love it,positive
hes such a great science communicator were lucky to have him,positive
theres no such thing as dumb question i hope a lot of people especially teachers understand this,positive
i love how he says theres a nobel prize waiting to find that answer like hes telling us to not fear math or physics and give it s try haha i love it ,positive
string theory could not be more simplified than this 0210 not all genius minds can teach well his students are lucky,positive
this is how you teach and speak about a subject when you have mastered it so interesting stimulating and easy to follow most high school teachers are not experts and have not mastered their craft this is one issue with public education and kids get turned off and tune outthen land here and are again inspired and motivated to learn again,neutral
i’m eleven years old and wanting to get a start on physics early to get into a good college and this is precisely the thing i am looking for thank you so much,positive
this is so much better than it was in school,positive
me failing math  also me i’m gonna be a physicist ,neutral
i love the way you explain all of this thank you so much for sharing this and explaining so well for the motivational words you throw in while you explain i learn so much with your videos and wanted to express my gratitude  please don’t stop making videos,positive
you are amazing currently taking physics in my senior year of college and got a professor who is new at teaching soso confusing but you explain it so well ,positive
we live in a privileged age where we have the benefit of massive accumalated knowledge of the generations before us,positive
ive never felt like physics is so approachable until watching this video great content,positive
25 years old and well versed in physics this was engaging to me even though i already knew the info and that shows how well this man teaches future bookmark for home schooling my kids,positive
very motivating introduction to physics,positive
“you’re smarter than me” kid yeah,neutral
dad so what did the physics man teach you son child nothing that i didnt know already,neutral
bro the 9 year old is literally smarter than the whole twitter community,neutral
im a physics graduate and watching the experts discussions made me feel like sht the more you learn the more you realize how much you actually dont know,negative
the first kid in this video is way beyond most kids with his ability to understand abstract concepts the fact he was able to answer some of those questions was really impressive and not at all typical,positive
they cheated by hiring the smartest 8yearold they could find,negative
“you don’t understand anything until you’re able to explain it to someone who’s never studied it” this guy understands it,neutral
that ending blew my mind the fact that our universe brane could intersect or wrap etc with other three dimensional universes to produce fourdimensional ones makes sense how do you form a cube with a bunch of slices of squares how do you form four dimensions with a bunch of slices of threedimensional branes,neutral
the kid explained physics very well for that man glad he shared his knowledge,positive
all of these people are very well educated for their respective maturity groups the 9 year old is very bright the teenager is wise beyond her years and the college student guy had some encouraging curiosity,positive
im curious to see what will be added to that map in 20 years,neutral
as an astronomy major and studying astrophysics this makes me more excited in the field im currently learning,positive
physicists are not quittersyouve saved my life,positive
i loved this it was very informative and a great overview could you perhaps do a map of engineering too,positive
fun fact my school has this poster in their physics class i saw it was from youtube and searched it,positive
i know theyre all science subjects and ive found them genuinely very very helpful so i was just wondering if youve ever thought about making a map for business or economics or well commerce students im in the middle of shifting from sci to commerce depending on my exam results that is but ive loved all of your maps thus far so id really appreciate it if you ever make a video on business management or banking or stocks or anything along those lines just a tiny suggestion,positive
this is the most interesting video i have ever watched about physics in general thank you,positive
i love physics i cant express it in words,positive
its one of the most interesting videos that ive ever seen in my life i wanted to get an idea a kind of overview of the laws of our physical reality being represented as a total picture which youve rightly named as the map of physics and youve shown it wonderfully in your video im very thankful grateful to you for enlightening us with the gift of knowledge in such an orderly interesting form in its totality and many thanks to you for adding philosophy to its end for addressing the unending quests of mankind for the unknown unknowable truths,positive
ive studied a bit of all sorts of physics quantum physics classical and relativistic physics regarding nuclear energy and radioactive decay but ive noticed that the classical physics of nyoton is still the hardest for me especially the motion of liquids and solid objects like projectiles,negative
in a parallel universe worthless neil would be watching me explaining quantum mechanics,neutral
watching neil keeps my mind open to possibilities,positive
this man can make anything fascinating and make me want to listen to him,positive
the only reason i wanted to learn more about quantum physics is because i was listening to dr tyson’s podcast where he mentioned quantum entanglement and that einstein didn’t think it was a thing calling it “spooky action at a distance” now my brain is a contradiction in terms in that i’m mathematically challenged seriously algebra might as well be sandscript but i understand calculus i’ve never found anyone that explain this to me lol so when dr tyson was explaining quantum entanglement i got the concept but i needed more info like trying to understand how an engine works by looking at the fuel fill and exhaust pipe and i know i’m just some guy but after reading everything i could get my hands on that wasn’t written for phd candidates it dawned on me that this might be our ticket to the stars my physics teacher in hs said that the only natural force that humans can’t manipulate is gravity and we’d have to be able to manipulate it if we ever want to explore other solar systems but excuse my ignorance if we can figure out how to manipulate quantum entanglement we would have the means to sidestep the cosmic speed limit,neutral
some day well laugh at ourselves for being so puzzled by quantum physics,neutral
i got addicted scratching my head watching videos related to quantum mechanics,positive
ndt you cant get crazier than quantum mechanics my girlfriend hold my beer,neutral
this is amazing  i’m so excited for the future of these science discoveries,positive
quantum entanglement kinda sounds like that if a tree falls in the woods with no one around does it make a sound question except the answer is that it both does and doesnt untill you hear it,neutral
the universe is fractal therefore the same rules that apply to a solar system must apply to an atom except at faster speeds otherwise the universe would collapse in disarray and conflict empirical observations of the micro universe are as good as the equipment utilized to collect them if one observes a particle planet around the nucleus sun with a shutter speed equal to one revolution it would register at one position only 12 cycle would result in two opposite positions at higher speeds more positions are collected and the vibration wave function starts to reveal itself what is missing in our science at the particle level is the inclusion of the interaction between the particle and the energy dissipated from the device used to observe it equipment or human brain,neutral
professor kaku i’m so glad he was asked to explain this for us i am also excited that cnn is talking about this it’s what we should spend more time talking about fascinating things like this,positive
in my physic class the professor said “just perhaps someday we may know of there are other planets besides those our solar system” now we know of over 5000,neutral
i wish stephen hawking was still alive to hear this,neutral
how wonderful to hear from a physicist about the new information about planets in our system and seeing planets in other galaxies my late father who was a farmer in the midwest would come into the house from the fields to watch nasa rocket deployments and returns oh how he would have loved this new exploration thank you,positive
he always sounds so excited about what hes talking about now that is passion,positive
i always love listening to prof kaku he always does such a great job at explaining difficult concepts in ways that can be understood by the interested layperson like me and his passion and enthusiasm are always contagious,positive
this was awesome more please,positive
up until now i was not impressed but now whoa  this picture is amazing,positive
it’s hard to believe it’s been five years since the president of the united states stared at an eclipse twice,negative
thats a great explanation thank you professor,positive
science should not be about whether you are good at it or not it should only be about whether you are interested,neutral
quantum physics for 7 year olds 37 year old me sounds good,positive
this talk was very healing for me i had some difficult experiences with science as a middle schooler i was placed in advanced english and science classes but i never really got science i was made fun of by my teacher from that experience i came to believe that me and science dont mix but now that im older i realize i do love science when its explained well and when it relates to something i care about i really do want to learn about quantum physics but have been intimidated about where to start your simple little explanations opened a door for me dominic i send you love and appreciation across the quantum waves,positive
if you cant explain it simply you dont understand it well enough einstein,neutral

after watching this i realize i’m only six years old,neutral
four principles of technical communication 1 start at the right point from known to unknown show of hands err on the side of caution 2 dont go too far into the rabbit hole explain 3 things that pique interest rather than a whole load of information 3 clarity is better than accuracy iron out the finer details later 4 explain why it is cool enthusiasm is key most importantly convey it is not about whether you are good or bad at it it is all about being interested in it,positive
i wish my physics teacher was like him it doesn’t matter if you’re good at it all that matters is that you have interest,positive
hes so humble wish my teachers were like him,positive
the hardest part of that first trick is wrestling a cane away from an old lady at the park theyre deceptively strong,neutral
my take probably messed some up 1 the cane gets stabilized by the fact that the lighter side of the cane gets less friction form your finger than the heavier side so that finger moves faster towards the com of the cane this causes the effect to flip and the fingers slowly align themselves around the center of mass 2 the phone is not evenly weighed so spinning it in some axis would make it destabilize right well the same effect is observed when spinning a brick it fell on my foot twice while i tested that that i played around with i believe this effect occurs because of the fact that the center of mass of the brickphone is in the middle of the whole object so rotating it around the axis that allows more mass to rotate around further from the com will work because the particles far away have to have less momentum the spin is easier on the other hand spinning the phone the other way makes more particles have more energy so this state is unstable the phone starts to spin in a way that makes some of the particles decelerate which is a more stable state rhyme unintended the same thing is observed when spinning around and then extending your hands out which causes you to decelerate 3 this one is a bit of a troll i tested deuterium water and distilled water and the distilled one produced no less effect it’s not the water that is attracted to the cup it’s the stuff in it ions 4 the cereal contains some iron which is magnetic this makes it attracted to the magnet maybe but what is interesting is that water and glass fex are pushed away by magnets it’s diamagnetic anyways maybe the magnet makes like a small cavity in the water that the cereal falls into i did not observe one i do not know but i did manage to destroy a box of good cereal and throw the cereal all over the floor 5 hot air rises as the hot air creates a rising bubble the material the tea bag is made out of slowly burns away when it gets light enough it slowly flies up hope i am correct hand have a nice day edit watched the answers video,neutral
how does this work hmm i dont know why dont you tell m number two,negative
the last one is very cool i got hold of 40 out of date teabags and brought them in to science club thank you for the awesome ideas,positive
349 this is actually one of traditional games in my country but normally we use an oil paper or newspaper first we glue every end of corner each other then we make a little hole at the center by using a needle then we blow the paper from the hole until it expands like a pillow finally we light every corner of the pillow paper at the same time it will fly and look like a japanese fireball ghost in the sky,neutral
also for all you wouldbe explainers 2 works for perfectly symmetric objects in a vacuum,neutral
the reason why 1 works isn’t just because of the method but because in the first case you only have one finger the center of mass is always a point and since you’ve only got one point of contact where your finger touches the cane there is effectively a 0 chance the center of mass is exactly on that contact point and thus starts leaning towards one side or another if you use the second method there’s two points of contact and thus as long as the center of mass is inbetween it cannot tilt you can try finding the center of mass on your own with two fingers together without using the special method and just doing it normally and you’ll see it works fine tldr you don’t need a special method to balance on the center of mass you just need two fingers so that there are two contact points for the center of mass to be between,neutral
4 might have something to do with the 4th phase of water its a relatively newly discovered phenomena that negatively charged particles inside of water seem to cluster close to nonwater surfaces theres a chargeless layer after that and then a layer of positive charge which creates a natural bipole which could act as a magnet when stimulated with another magnet and basically push the cereal along and possibly even as work as a battery as the scientist explaining it pointed out im no expert obviously but there was a ted talk that i watched on youtube on the topic which was fascinating i suggest you look it up,neutral
first one works thanks to friction when the imbalance occurs friction cancels out the speeds on each side which kind of forces you to move them accordingly so that the momentum on the sides are equal,neutral
on the first one it works because when your hand is closer to one side the friction slows it down on each side until when your fingers meet and the object is balanced this should work as long as each hand is moving at relatively the same speed the same force and there isnt any other significant variables,positive
teaching bleedingedge science to a general audience me without making it feel watered down is done nowhere else as well as here thanks to all involved,positive
years ago i was a physics major life didnt turn out the way i initially expected and now im in cs classes including theory of computation this video is very much the intersection of stuff ive studiedstudying and hits hard,negative
this sounds reminiscent of gödels incompleteness theorem he was able to abstract away the mathematical operations and describe any possible equation as a binary choice between it being true or false much like how the counterfactuals are either possible or impossible and allow you to ignore the specific equations themselves,neutral
it would definitely revolutionize how science is taught in schools anyway whether it is the all in one thing that ties them together or not it could be incredibly useful as a learning tool,positive
so if i understand constructor theory correctly in this world there are only two laws that matter what a man can do and what a man cant captain jack sparrow a physicist ahead of his time,neutral
it strikes me that as a layman typically in physics theres only one or two right answers about how a system can evolve seeing as this is something of an epistemological framework i like epistemology and theyre important for getting new perspectives and theres a functionally infinite expansion of the number of ways a complex system can evolve im struggling to see how were going to find this needle in a haystack of cans and cants that is without lots and lots of ways to generate new ideas about how the system will evolve and new razors for eliminating impossible actions,neutral
wouldnt constructor theory fundamentally be assuming we know all the base sets of rules in order to be correct otherwise it could rule out things that are possible but they just dont have a truth statement for in the base set of rules,neutral
this is the best explanation of counterfactuals and constructor theory ive seen i am sure a lot of good work went in to making it so simple to understand thank you,positive
i very often find myself not wondering what david deutsch is up to these days and i would be entirely happy to hear about constructor theory after it has accomplished some accomplishments or gathered some buyin within the discipline instead of as currently seems to be the case before,positive
745 weve had an algebra of possibility for over 70 years its called modal logic and the standardly used semantics for it is possible worlds semantics also known as kripke semantics it has its own operators theorems etc and is used extensively in philosophy,neutral

people who take time out of their lives to make this much content over challenging subjects are the greatest types of people on the planet idk who runs this but i cannot express how thankful i am for them to get this type of assistance from a real person id be paying hundreds and hundreds of dollars to learn the same thing i actually watch these videos on spring break for the joy of simply learning thank you,positive
lets help this guy by not skipping on the ads and subscribe to his channel im preparing for my board exams in electro engineering and this helps me really alot thank you man,positive
i cant begin to describe how frustrated and hopelessly lost i felt trying to learn physics the first time around if it wasnt for your videos and help i dont think i could stay within my major your work is absolutely invaluable and your videos are actually life changing for me i cant afford tutors but these videos give me a real fighting chance to achieve all of my educational goals thank you so so so so much you are an absolute gem and i hope you know how much we all appreciate you 3,positive
my professor uses your videos to teach us during online class it has come to the point that we recognize you as our professor more thanks for your vids,positive
i just wanted to say that your physics playlist helped me immensely to get a 5 on the ap physics c mechanics exam your videos are a godsend and i extremely appreciate all the work you put into them ill definitely be revisiting this channel during college,positive
is it weird that its one of the goals of my life to meet this person just so much that he helped me a lot during a lot of hard times words arent enough to express how grateful i am and blessed are we to have someone like this amazing person teach his knowledge for free and continues to do so i salute you sir thank you for helping me out through times,positive
this kind of youtube channel deserves an award for the effort and time the creator has put in to help students great summary and review i salute you sir btw ill be taking soon may nmat exam for medicine goodluck to mee,positive
a mistake at 13353 it was meant to be 20m on the incline instead of 10m but overall i get the way it work and good explations thanks alot,positive

when looking at the salt water glass around time index 637 if you look carefully you can see a difference in the layers between the fresh water from the ice cube and the salt water that the ice cube is floating in,neutral
i think it would be cool to see how the results of the ice experiment varies when you use a fresh water ice cube in the fresh water glass and a salt water ice cube in the salt water glass you can also test using salt water cubes in both glasses and compare all the combinations very nice video,positive
i thoroughly enjoyed this science talk and learnt quite a lot then i would in class thank you now onto your next video as i down my nonequilibrium beverage ,positive
ohhhhh my god i wait for these episodes like most people wait for the next tom cruise movie thank god for brian greene for showing us the beauty of physics,positive
so great to see leonard susskind on air this is how physics should be presented no egos no showboating just great minds discussing complex concepts that us mere mortals can begin to understand,positive
seriously thank you i particularly am sad that i never pursuid physics in my higher education as these are the subjects that bring colour to my life i think it might not be praised enough that we still get to learn about these amazing ideas even more so from the most incredible field experts for free from anywhere in the world i would like to take these few minutes to show my gratitude towards these actions and to professor brian greene thank you all for your contributions looking for answers or more questions and communicating us the findings forever grateful,positive
i loved when you take a glance at mark listening to leonard speak because he just has the biggest smile on his face you can tell how much respect everyone has for each other and their individual interpretations this was a phenomenal listen and i can’t wait for more,positive
yet another marvelous production from the world science festival i wait for every new episode as if sitting at the edge of my seat as these brilliant hardworking individuals reveal more details about the saga we call “life” thank you so much brian greene for taking the time to help connect us with all of this valuable insight,positive
thank you brian and everyone behind the scenes who make wsf you are doing a great service,positive
i hope to see more of ana i can imagine discussing concepts like this in depth in your non native language would be extremely difficult but i also think that in situations like that the different viewing angle can be very revealing for example there are words in native cultures languages that describe entire concepts in the english language and vice versa sometimes things that are hidden from one perspective become obvious when looked at from another because parallels between concepts emerge beyond the language itself i think i may have just broken my brain hahaha anyway i love these thanks to everyone who was on it and of course brian,neutral
i was gratified enticed by dr susskind’s implication of the time ‘shear’ near the event horizoneh because it supports questions i have been asking for years about the structure of a black hole which is commonly dismissed as “an unexplainable singularity at the center of the eh” that i have long believed is nonsensical without mention of relative rates of time layering i note that feynmans qed is not actually sensible explanatory or even rational but only exquisitely descriptive this vid also illuminated for me the ubiquitous ‘hairiness’ of the universe as a thick tangle of erepr entanglement ‘filaments’ stretched in at least 4d by an infinitude of time sheared partners i think this makes the universe a relatively big but very tiny place,neutral
please keep these amazing episodes coming brian greene is so good at bringing everything and everyone together to present these amazing theories to all compelling with stellar production more please,positive
brian is just incredible i loved physics growing up and wanted to be a quantum physicist but also loved medicine and became a doctor but my heart feels alive when i read any papers on quantum physics and attend such lectures may be one day i will become physicist for now i learn through such amazing videos and papers thanks so so much,positive

thank you for finally explaining “string theory” in words a nonphysics person as myself could understand now maybe you could explain why it isn’t called vibration theory i believe with that i would have been more accepting of what you said today years ago,positive
i remember watching michio kakus shows on discovery science as a kid he made me interested in science and i probably learned english from those shows and if i traveled back in time to close the tv then its likely i wouldnt go back to being an engineer im a little sad to see him getting older 10 years later but im glad that he is as passionate about string theory as ever its funny how some people can change your life without them ever knowing,positive
i have a theory that i would like to get out if this is the leading theory we are to accept you inspired me when i was a young child michio kaku i read your book hyperspace when i was about 12 and it changed my life i have since been building upon many theories of many great minds such as yourself and i think i have discovered something that i feel i should go public with as soon as possible ive never written a book before it is intimidating and one day i hope to have your blessing because without you i may have never come to these ideas and even within my theory there is a place for string theory as it embodies such a theory in a way i hope to meet you one day thank you for everything,positive
as history goes all that was once a theoryhypothesisdream has been turning out to be possible in more than one occasion kudos to you professor kaku,positive
dr kaku nice to see you still educating us on the exciting elements of life in the universe you and i met in december of 1999 when i was a producer at fox news channel working on our y2k special the program focusing on what the future held for humankind was a big success and in my opinion you were the star,positive
want to get smarter faster subscribe for daily videos,positive
this dude makes it look easy respect,positive
he repeats his stories alot and tbh i think thats what made him such a good explainer he hones the same explanation until he masters it and finally blesses us young minds,positive
ive been following mr kaku for nearly 15 years now and he is still till this very day the best professor i have ever seen anywhere he influenced more young brains than people give him credit for people who will unlock the secrets of dark matter and so on will be people who were influenced by this man at some point in their life and thats amazing this man is perfect thank you sir professor michio kaku,positive
he makes everything seem so evident and easy im glad to be born in a period where this man exists ,positive
this was the most comprehensible and engaging physics lesson i’ve ever witnessed the realization that the big bang was the fissioning of universes…wow and i actually understood the description of worm holes incredible knowledge and presentation,positive
i have been a fan of dr kaku for decades his knack for breaking down complex subjects into easily understandable terms combined with a refreshing sense of humor makes dr kaku a natural teacher and a pleasure to listen to,positive
i would like to say thank you to all of the historical pioneers that have discovered the building blocks of bothscience and mathematics each of you are brilliant shining “stars”,positive
this guy never fails to make me feel like im learning something while also teaching absolutely nothing new and simply conceptualizing every sentence,positive
michio kaku maybe the most captivating educator i have ever listened to he is one of very few who make it a sheer joy to learn how to understand things,positive

neutrinos are what got me into physics when i was 18 years old and the more i learn about them the more fascinating they become,positive
neutrino oscillations might sound somewhat mysterious but really its just linear algebra complex numbers unitary matrices eigenvectors and so on she always makes me smile ,positive
i remember reading about neutrinos 40 years ago they had just built neutrino detectors and had calculated the predicted number of events from solar neutrinos the estimates were off by 13 they had not hypothesized the neutrino mixing at that time,neutral
a thing i found amazing is that something like 10 of the energy from a nuclear reactor is carried away by the neutrinos it radiates,positive
thank you sabine i love when you go into this level of detail or more,positive
sabine please keep making these videos about whats not known in physics its these types of things that can really drive a person to want to study the field i also appreciate you talking about situations where physics may be on the wrong track physics shouldnt be about jumping on the bandwagon of whats popular,neutral
ahhh problems with the standard model whod have guessed i had some wonderful arguments with particle physicists while living near cern a few years back but ive had problems with this particular theory since the copenhagen interpretation of the 1920s,negative
thank you sabine so we’ll thought out and executed my mind expands every time i hear you explain ,positive
i really enjoy many of sabines videos very informative its great to have critical thinkers for these complex issues she can be a great debunker as well she seems very objective and unafraid to step on anyones toes,positive

when youtube search gives you exactly what you were looking for it’s new it’s long it’s well explained finally some good youtube,positive
as a physics student i have to say that this is an amazing introduction to the standard model this video deserves to be played at schools as part of their curriculum it explains all of the important aspects in a simple way that upcoming students can easily understand thank you for your contributions to science communication,positive
less than halfway through the video and its already one of the bestexplained quantum physics videos ive ever seen,positive
2400 interestingly enough at high enough optical intensities beyond those attainable by current lasers it is possible for photons to interact with one another this study of photonphoton interactions is known as nonlinear optics for example two photons can combine to create a photon with twice as much energy however due to these high intensities not being common in daily life this isnt frequently observed outside of laboratories,neutral
ive been rewatching this for a while now its actually pretty interesting but im finding it hard to understand the leptons especially the lepton numbers symmetries and the neutrinos but except all that i understood the rest you really explained very well and you made it very comprehensive and detailed thanks very much,positive
hey thanks for including the bit about the neutron lifetime question i have worked on the ucntau experiment and its nice to see this parameter mentioned as an important question for those curious the lifetime is believed to be around 880 sec but the statistics are still underperforming and of course this result deviates from the older bottlebeam experiments by such a degree that there is not yet a consensus,neutral
the best explanation i have ever seen about the standard model congratulations,positive
can you do a map of all simple groups in abstract algebra that would be awesome,positive
i wish i had seen this years ago trying to visualize particle physics in my head has always been my stumbling block and this video just made it a whole lot easier,positive

ive been doing thermodynamics in some way shape or form for three years now and this has been by far the best presentation for these concepts that ive come across thanks dr shini lecturers could literally spend two days explaining what she did in ten minutes in class you guys are awesome,positive
i love everything about this video i wish my expensive classes were as entertaining and as cleverly put together,positive
loving the series thank you for all your hard work,positive
this is so helpful weve been doing thermodynamics as uni but i tend to sit in letcures with my eyes glazed over because i didnt fully understand the basics when we first learned them so anything more complicated is too confusing,positive
this is honestly sooo helpful keep up the good work,positive
thank you for this video i am taking thermodynamics 2 right now and this is honestly a great review of all the basic thermo ideas,positive

physics is so interesting when you actually get to know and understand it i really want to sue all my school teachers for not doing their jobs correctly and for only scraping the surface when it comes to physics it really is just so frustrating when you are so interesting in something that you cant even understand properly,negative
why not try skillshare totally free for one month ,neutral
very cool stuff at first i thought they need to explain these effects verbally then i saw the written notes you have pointed out some very good examples of how physics can be weird and provided links and explanations for effects very good job,positive
music that isnt obnoxious no numbers no annoying narrator actually pretty cool tricks not clickbait a my guys love it,positive
i love these experiments so usable and functional for people in quarantine at home love it ,positive
a similar demonstration of the dropping magnet is a solid metal disk connected to a pivot so it swings through the jaws of a large powerful magnet the metal disk is not attracted to the magnet but when allowed to swing through the magnetic field its motion is slowed and almost stopped if a series of closely spaced slots are cut into the disk and the experiment repeated the disk swings through almost unhindered the slots disrupt the currents needed to generate the opposing magnetic field,neutral
i really enjoyed this video i love how it teach everything in a so simple and easy way and best of all its short and eyecatching,positive
this is absolutely amazing thank you for explaining everything no numbers no annoying narrators and just actually being legit good people,positive

after all the years i have been interested in physics i love finding out new things about how the discoveries were made and the people involved,positive
amazing lecture suzie and excellent way of taking a stand on the nature of science and how we have used it and how we should use it you could have even talked more about the scientistcivilians sacrificing or loosing their lives after doing experiences with new inventions etc many lives were lost due the lack of safety issues back in the days or just due to not knowing all the side effects etc excellent job suzie i am very amazed by your work and by your wisdom,positive
what a fantastic journey through the discovery of physics fascinating well done suzie for making a difficult subject to understand so accessible frankly i didnt think that this would be an easy watch but it was well explained and your excitement for science is quite infectious im looking forward to reading your book excelsior,positive
outstanding lecture interesting and fun thank you,positive
truly a remarkable presentation i read probably my most highly inspirational book by my newfound role model fundamentals the ten keys to reality by frank wilczek who he references experiments as well as other interesting findings in this presentation there’s also the book qed the strange theory of light and matter by richard p feynman which this video helps me visualize the xrays excitements these all ultimately lead me to a sense of motivation and question as to what’s left to discover well i position myself towards ligo virgo kagra into understanding gravity and gravitational waves of course education follows but for now i am currently reading a booklet called relativity the 100th anniversary as instructed i have not proceeded further until i am fully convinced on the requirement needed in chapter 8 for the vitality of humankind,positive
an excellent subject and lecture thank you,positive
really inspiring talk thank you so much,positive
very well presented and informative well done suzie and i will buy her book,positive
what a great way of explaining with a love for the subject thank you,positive

i saw a video by veritasium where he showed the moiré lattice pattern he held two transparent sheets of a honeycombish pattern overlapping and i remember seeing the different shapes and structures emerging being completely fascinated i got way too excited about it and felt silly im a 30 year old woman and i wanted to have these sheets myself to explore these patterns theyre beautiful i knew there was something to it and this video makes me very very happy cant wait to see more from this research and channel im a new subscriber,positive
id love to see a more indepth video about the mechanics of how the stacked sheets create virtual atoms what are the limitations are there any conceivable functionalcommercial uses beyond research what an exciting development in physics research im surprised this is the first im hearing of this techniquetechnology,positive
so many developments like this seem hypey but this one dropping to 2d is such a beautiful simplification lends itself to sanetime computer simulation the moiré bit again beautiful reminds me a lot of xray crystallography maybe similar potential for discovering how stuff works,positive
this channel is so high quality and criminally underwatched another a video,positive
can someone explain something to me not a trained scientist how many of these virtual atoms can they manipulate at once are they able to scale the quantity up enough to make for instance clouds of virtual hydrogen helium etc,neutral
this was bound to happen next up 3d printing materials atom by atom and then mass production and what if you combined this 2d with penrose tiling patterns and stacked those what would the moiré pattern look like,neutral
wow this feels like game changing research new technology here we come material sciences are fascinating,positive
whoa i love this type of minimalist approach to problems in general its so elegant here very inspiring,positive
humans are smart but i think we are really learning insight into our abilities when we try to understand what we perceive is the moon there when we dont look at it read about object permanence in psychology for instance there are many other interesting correlations like this which may shed some light on observation we are reaching the limit of being able to discern what is novel with what could be attributed to another already agreed understanding even if the correlation is not obvious even our inherent bias may get in the way and like any puzzle such as a sadoku we may eventually learn that the complex mathematics could be on the wrong track and have to be scrapped only to have to start basically from some previous branch no matter how far back and finally it seems we are fast running out of feasible experiments to confirm or deny the predictions made by quantum mechanics,positive
there actually just has to be some sort of connection that we don’t see or understand yet,neutral
absolutely fascinating thank you thank you,positive

meanwhile this evening i did a bad impression of prof cox on stage to a few hundred people and even though it was so dodgy everyone knew who it was as he’s such a legend nice to hear him talk about sagan as many see him as a modern version,positive
we are a way for the universe to know itself carl sagan of course the scientist with the heart of a poet excellent discussion with a favorite physicist professor brian cox i could listen to him all day thank you be smart and pbs for the thoughtprovoking video subscribed,positive
you sir are a superlative teacher and so is professor cox this has been one of the most fascinating interviews and youtube presentations that i have seen but then i’m an old man an old medical doctor of a man who has had the pleasure of experiencing many good and great teachers in his lifetime and learning new things for me remains one of my greatest pleasures and this border conjunction between the life sciences and the physical sciences is one of my greatest fascinations i am so very glad that i found your channel and subscribed to it,positive
brian cox as always doesn’t disappoint… he’s very deep and thoughtful in a very accessible way…,positive
i absolutely love professor brian cox after watching his tedtalk about a year ago i watched as many videos of him as i could and he has incredibly increased my interest in physics and astronomy thank you for the great video,positive
this channel is a key example of why publicly funded media is still so important in the digital era the right people given the right resources can do amazing things and grow to provide so much more value to society than what was invested keep up the amazing work,positive
very thought provoking video ive always found brian coxs viewpoints very interesting he sees the same things as other scientists but he helps us think about it just a little differently than many which can help us think differently ourselves fascinating,positive
one of the most interesting informative and thoughtprovoking discussions i have ever seen thanks guys,positive
something funny i just noticed aside from looking sort of alike both brian cox and shigeru miyamoto seem to almost be incapable of speaking without smiling being experts in completely different fields both just seem so curious and enjoying what they do what a joy to listen to these guys and just have them around,positive

its truly a great time to be alive to be able to have resources like this be so freely available for anyone to use,positive
this is remarkably clearly communicated almost unique every single wording every sentence is chosen with a purpose the examples are very descriptive needless to say the topic is a bit complex it is adressed subject to an almost perfect understanding of exactly when the apprentice finds some topic extra difficult imagine having a teacher like this when being in formative years sometimes in life you happen to encounter people with an abovehuman talent to communicate complex matters in an accessible way simple enough but not to simple it is important to recognize this and to cherish those rare moments,positive

i remember watching this exactly 10 years ago and being amazed by it i tried the experiment in an empty classroom 10 years later physics still fascinates me,positive
i can learn more from this dude than my actually physics teacher ,positive
i miss his lectures so much they were posted here on youtube for a while i’m not sure if they are anymore but he is one of the reasons i love physics,positive

i had and experienced this same experiment in a high school physics class in 1959 as we studied pendulum motion the teacher of that class was a phd physicist taking a two year sabbatical from a national lab his demonstration also included a lesson in the difference between what we say and what we believe each of us sat on a high stool as a shotput suspended from the high ceiling by a cable was brought up to within an inch or two of our nose he asked each of us do you know the laws of pendulum motion our response was of course yes then just as he released the shotput he said know we will see if you believe them most but not all sat still as that eight pounds of lead rocketed back towards our noses only a few ducked away a the last second that was 63 years ago i remember it like it was yesterday sadly today that teacher would not be able to do that experiment or any of the other amazing things he did in that classroom the lessons are to structured preprogramed and rigid for creative teachers to inspire the young minds and imaginations of their students plus the specter of liability would be the death of any imaginative and creative teaching,neutral

i love how you start building up from the historical background something we don’t see often i hope you will upload more often,positive
it always amazed me that when i was in school everything about quantum mechanics was a synonym of something very difficult and counterintuitive thanks to the pop culture and popular science articlesvideos on youtube after studying in university it turned out to be much easier espesially considering that classcial mechanics is not that simple either if i saw this video 5 years ago i would have understood that fact earlier thank you for this clear and neat explonation,positive
outstanding work i somehow managed to understand all of it whilst understanding none of it at each stage coming from a nonphysics background and with only a limited understanding of calculus to be able to carry a viewer with my limited ability along is testament to your superb communication thank you,positive

we need more people like penrose he is really thinking outside the box he doesnt put assumptions on all the things he learned like many smart people still do we need more people like him who is curious and ask the right questions he truly knows where the black spots are in our knowledge he points them out clearly we are watching a genious of our time 200 years from now he will be known because he was one of the few who understood how little we know and where we should look,positive
wow i am so glad i discovered dr penrose today i wanted to refrain from any comments but i have to say that the interviewer asked better questions than dr peterson and he seemed to understand what prof penrose was meaning whilst dr petersons brain seemed to shortcircuited a few times my view is that dr peterson came in with an upfront agenda not to learn but to convince kudos to prof penrose for schooling dr peterson okay i said enough,positive

damn this man is sharp for his age my granddad bless his soul only got to live to the age of 79 and in his last 3 years he deteriorated to such a degree that he couldnt function at all it was sad to witness sir penrose is 90 now almost 91 and he talks about stuff in a very clear way which most adults arent able to do amazing,negative
it’s crazy to see dr jordan peterson learning when i see him in videos i just assume he knows everything already like he just has a flash drive plugged in somewhere,neutral
dr peterson there is another physicist turned philosopher who wrote a lot about the nature of the mind and of consciousness basing himself in his understanding of physics his name was david bohm he is now deceased but he wrote a book called wholeness and the implicate order in which he discusses several things which might be relevant to this conversation and which i found very enlightening i recommend it to you and while youre at it you might as well also look into his interpretation of quantum mechanics called bohmian mechanics since you showed interest in quantum theory his interpretation gets rid of the inconsistencyincompleteness from which the standard interpretation suffers in an elegant and easy to understand way and in a way which takes all of the apparent magic out of the theory i was fascinated to see that roger penrose uses godel incompleteness to support his views on the nature of consciousness since i came to the same conclusions on my own years ago based on the same mathematics so cool to hear my ideas coming from the mouth of such a brilliant man,positive

i think perpetual motion will be eventually possible not by violating laws of physics but by tapping the fundamental forces of the universe instead of chemical fuels and such the only trick is deciding what k8nd of entropy to exhaust into,neutral
all of these are awesome i think i want to master the discipline of physics it is one of the greatest phenomena in nature,positive
great video thank you on my channel are a series of ion propelled aircrafts that are patented specifically for lifting their power supplies against earths gravity they can fly with no moving mechanical parts they create a downdraft with solid state electronics that is sufficient to propel them upwards they dont defy physics though rather they rely on wellknown physics it used to be that ion propulsion could not lift its power supply from the ground there are more than 40 public videos of the craft,positive
amazing video thank you yes atomic motion is perpetual mass changing its position in space motion perpetual well for most of us billions of years is long enough so examples of perpetual motions does not factor in wear and tear of the device solar panels water mills wind mills geo thermal iceland john bedini generator which uses a drive battery that looses only a few milliamps while the charging battery gains hundreds of millivolts i personally recharged hundreds of batteries with carefully measured results the physics here at play is to not be stuck to one view one device and what it does by itself yes thats being confined to thermodynamics however look outside the box for energy source solar panels obtain their energy not from photovoltaic panels but from the sun thermodynamics is true in closed or isolated systems nitinol is also overunity which perpetual motion is a part of using cold and hot water to activate it cyclically the most abundant phase of matter in the universe is plasma an electrically charged ionized gas well a lot of energy could be pulled out of these stellar gas and they will be energized until the end of time by stars are we introverted into a small device set in motion or are we scientifically logically looking at the big picture as long as we stay stuck in a boxedin frame of reference we dont progress every advances made was possible by women and men who dared looking at things holistically from all points of view cheers,positive

love susskind and his no nonsense outlook on the world ,positive
quantum entaglement is a phenomenon that must be researched much more it is simply amazing,positive
the trouble with the holographic notion is pov point of view on the one hand and photon density on the other …… then if we had three or more hands all of the substance that can’t be “projected” and of course light speed having said that i do agree that all of the forces are actually expressions of the same phenomenon that being the interaction of matter energy with the higgs field at the plank scale to my thinking this interaction elevates the energy level of the field proportional to the interacting mass and this is gravity the energy level of which creates the effect of the curvature of space so that is another effect that cannot be projected as a hologram,neutral
on the stanford channel i obsessively watched all of susskinds lectures,positive
so correct a civilization cant only rely on an abstract science but on technology as well,neutral
what would it look like if we met the extent of the knowledge god allowed us to know it would be like we were contained inside of a realm like a bubble and so one part of the bubble is connected to the next part of the bubble and it is all connected but we can never know what is outside of the bubble to know how the bubble truly works because we can never be outside the bubble when pressed against the bubble we can see a bit ways outside of it to see that we are inside a bubble like finding balance between the left and right side of a bicycle god set limits of the ocean and of the mountains and of the thickness of our skin and since he will always know more than us he has set limits on what we are allowed to know but it is a good thing to flesh out all the areas we are allowed to know to make use of them,neutral
the audio is pulled from a talk given by susskind at uc berkeley search for it on youtube and you’ll find it not sure why this channel doesn’t cite that talk in the description they’re just repackaging sound bites with impressive graphics,negative
you know when someone is worth little if people talk about what he researches not what he accomplished or what his research accomplished everyone is constantly researching life just by living it but we dont give a shit unless you manage something useful and so is with this guy just very unremarkable,negative
i love how all the old theories that haven’t quite been proved to a few have been jumbled together into new science we are as a species so intelligent through trial error and years and years of mechanics and maths has brought us so close to answering so many deep questions about the universe when we as a species unlock all its secrets we will be the most dominant force in the universe,positive

newton should have asked himself how an apple even got up there,neutral
this video was so good i didn’t even realize it was 8 years old,positive
i think weve just found the most intense hype man for trees,positive
the goal of evaporation is to cool down the leaf the reason leafs are green is to avoid absorbing too much radiation the sun produces a lot of energy and similar to humans a tree needs to protect himself from sunlight think about how hot it gets at solar noon and the fact that the tree needs to sit in direct sunlight for the entire day the tree is literally cooling itself down through evaporative cooling similar to how humans do it through sweating this process is known as evapotranspiration,neutral
hank saying right was just praying to the gods of physics that there wasnt a pure vacuum in tree leaves,neutral
why should there be a height limit minecrafters liked that,neutral
its really amazing to think that this video is almost 10 years old i didnt even notice until after watching it compared to most other youtubers in 2012 this is god tier quality,positive
the second amazing thing is how do the roots pump moisture out of what can be half dry soil what human pump could duplicate that,positive
i’m a refrigeration technician and i realized a while back that the water evaporates out of the bottoms of the leaves to refrigerate them when water evaporates the vapor pulls heat from the remaining source water cooling it this is necessary because sunlight has the potential to heat the leaves beyond the temperature they can still function for photosynthesis,neutral
so in short trees do not bend the laws of physics trees use the laws of physics cleverly,neutral

math isnt my favorite subject but this looks so interesting i think that i can get good at this kind of math if i study and practice alot i really want to learn this stuff,positive
for all highschoolers and university students having midlife crisis computer science is fun since you get to build stuff that doesnt yet exist or build something that you use and make it a lot better computer science is the study of computers involving complex algorithms and youll be looking for stuff on the internet and stackoverflow alot you dont have to memorize everything like a computer but you have to know how to make a computer memorize and process the information and perform the activities that you want it to cs undergrad,positive
the way you described discrete maths made me realize i dont even hate math i just have to study to get better,positive
your videos are so solid and legitimately helpful you have an understanding of the topics and give in depth contentexamples thanks my man nuggets of youtube,positive

wow i swear this is one of the best youtube channels ive ever come across youre exceptionally knowledgeable about all these fields thank you so much,positive
good video im in the least popular branch in cs cs theory research im glad you mentioned induction if one dives into program verification youll see that induction is essential to doing any kind of proof because induction corresponds to recursion in programming induction on the natural numbers may not be interesting but think about induction on your data types and proving properties about them in fact induction does not only apply to natural numbers but any inductively defined set,positive
damn this got me more excited for computer science the discrete maths seems very interesting and eager to learn about it,positive
great video i’m back in school taking classes for my masters of computer science my bachelors was in economics im trying to decide on if i should do a concentration in big data management or cybersecurity what do you think is the better choice income and job market differences between these two,positive

now i know that programming cant be learn in 8 minutes,negative
im currently in my second year and im taking both c and java great video btw ,positive

it really depends on whether you are studying at a college or a university how theoretical it gets i just completed my bachelors of computer science at a university and basically programming is not being taught to you just very very minimally you are expected to do learn it yourself on your own and everyone does so anyways it is more a tool that you use for other courses than what you are learning towards i had a lot of theoretical courses in maths theoretical computer science complexity theory technical computer science transistors and stuff and practical computer science algorithms and datastructures you can use your programming skills everywhere to solve tasks and that is the beauty of it,neutral
i like this guys videos i probably watched his journey to becoming a microsoft engineer 5 times,positive
interviewer how long was your cs program me 12 minutes,neutral
this helped me feel more confident that im indeed learning stuff even though i still have a long road ahead it was good to realize half of the concepts already feel familiar if i may suggest a video idea you could do something similar to this but about frameworks libs deployers package managers compilers git docker and all that other tools and weirdly namedstuff that comes with learning a language because as a beginner all those names are really overwhelming  thanks for another great content youre really good explaining stuff,positive

540 another advantage of twos complement is that addition subtraction and multiplication on it are simpler you just do the same as with unsigned values one way to explain that is using modular arithmetic unless you use long arithmetic numbers are computed modulo 2 to the power of the number of bits in an integer and the numbers that the same bit string represents in unsigned types and in twos complement are equivalent,positive
what a well laid out video im starting a masters programme in cs at the end of the month after graduating as a bsc in physics and this video really helped in assuring myself that im not in over my head and am actually surprisingly familiar with the topics to come of course i dont mean to underestimate the amount of work to come but at least im more confident now,positive

agreed with patrick cs is more about theoretical knowledge whereas most of the people are going to deal with application level programming which requires more application level knowledge i think software engineering course suits the needs of most of the people in this regard,positive
computer science gives you a language to communicate your technical ideas as well as a framework and tools to evaluate them and while you can learn programmingdevelopment by watching a bunch of youtube videos if you lack the basic cs knowledge you will always struggle to make technical choices come up with a poorsuboptimal design while this is understandable that for some people the cs curriculum means a lot of depth which it certainly is it has big rewards on your software engineering job once you learn it well it is easy to supplement knowledge related to the latest trending technology but if you have knowledge gaps in your fundamentals youre gonna have a hard time overcoming those,positive
the degree is basically a foundation for anything that is to come after,neutral
its odd that everyone knows college is nearly useless yet every business requires you to have it just to be considered for an interview,negative
thanks patrick i raised 3 great kids my youngest is majoring in cs where i’m not qualified to mentor him been letting you handle that for me since 2018 now my whole family loves your videos many thanks for sharing your wisdom on tech and general life advice wishing you all the best,positive
when i started in computer science i was surprised how many of my classmates didnt even like to code they saw programming as at best a steeping stone to their real career my cs coursework certainly never taught me much programming my best teacher was my library of plum hall books in my case a professor liked my code and recommended me as a research assistant which was my first computer job the position was supposed to go to a cs grad student and i was an undergrad music major my research areas were mainly data compression and pattern recognition i was within a stones throw of finishing my music degree when i realized that i met the requirements for a cs degree so i ended up graduating with a cs major music minor even though i had 3 times as many hours in music as cs in my case i didnt program for long even though i enjoyed coding my bigger interest was systems and that is the direction i went after graduating,neutral
techlead this is a fantastic video very well done in my experience as a physics major with a minor in math and computer science i found that there are classes in every major that use computers and computer programming extensively in math we used programming to model complex physical systems that you could never do with out numerical analysis in physics we had a year lab where we made our own high speed data capture card we programmed it to capture data and then we wrote programs to analyze and display that data i think you are 100 correct when you state that the act of programming is very important for every discipline,positive
i was really under a lot of stress and pressure to pursue a masters degree and i was thinking of doing a computer science degree since i had a bachelors in it too but just like you said apart from 1 or 2 courses here the other courses are havoc the photographer example was spot on this video really helped me change my perspective thanks a lot i really feel like this video was tailor made for me thanks again subscribed ofc,positive
for me what got my career in coding started was my experience as a student programmer for a company near my university that hired me on basically as an intern they hired me because i worked for them on my senior capstone project fall semester so i worked for them as an intern during my last semester through that following summer and then i landed my first full time job in the fall i would have stayed with them had they been talking to me and expressed interest in actually treating me like an actual employee,positive
i agree with everything youre saying but how come you dont highlight the greatest gift of a computer science degree problem solving i struggled through school but now looking back im actually very glad i took these courses for one it taught me the limits of my knowledge and how much there is to learn taking these classes dont make you an expert in the field instead it teaches introduces you to the fundamentals in the broad field of computer science armed with this fundamental knowledge you can have a much clearer perspective of how the pieces come together and allows you to problem solve better sure it doesnt teach you the practical skills but problemsolving is an essential skill for any career especially in tech when you strip away all the fancy frameworks and the technologies that come and go at the core what you have is computer science which you can use to build these solutions,positive

right when i got into my first cs class in college i was expecting to learn a bunch of programming languages but in reality we just learnt only the concepts and wrote a 10 line program in c for two days and never did any other programming that first cs class made me hate cs because the material was way too quick i started reading the first 3 chapters while taking detailed notes of every paragraph and then it got too overwhelming since i was spending nearly 10 hours for each chapter just taking notes each week i didn’t have enough time so i stopped reading the textbook all together and started to hate it because i was just memorizing the concepts without actually understanding their uses i understood how they worked but not at all their applications my advice read the textbook briefly and don’t read every word so that you won’t become overwhelmed and stop reading all together,negative
one of the biggest things people should take into consideration if they’re gonna pursue any it jobs or anything related to cs is that it never ends you’ll constantly be trying to keep up with the latest tech or wondering if you need to bring getting the newest comptia cert or if your current if good enough it’s a rough life especially if you’re married or in a relationship it’s just constantly hours in front of the screen,negative

a modern computer science degree is basically a degree in discrete math but when computer science was founded it was much more closely related to being a science than it might be considered today however even if it has become more about proofs math and logic there still are investigations that require observing and testing factual information to determine breakthroughs as an example consider quantum computing and its development,neutral

pretty good summary i disagree with the statement that it isnt a science however cs researchers routinely make falsifiable claims about the real world and then test those claims through experiments in fact thats how im spending my winter holiday like if i solve this problem with method x instead of method y i get a more reliable answer of course if you only have empirical evidence ie its been tested in the real world your case is weaker than if you have a mathematical proof so in that way it might be that some problems cs folks tackle are scientific empirical questions until they can be handled more rigorously with mathematics but some big popular branches of cs like machine learning and ai advance primarily through empirical rather than mathematic evidence whether mathematics itself is a science i will leave to the writers of dictionaries,neutral
as a sidenote we dont know if prime factorization is npcomplete… and we dont know if its p either we only know its np id be surprised if someone discovered it to be in p—and also if someone found it to be npcomplete because this would mean quantum computers would solve npcomplete problems in polynomial time if someone proofs that prime factorization is not p and not npcomplete wed finally know once and for all that p np via ladners theorem,neutral

what i love about computer programming in particular is that unlike any other subject taught in schools this one forces students to use the creative and logical parts of their brains for once what every country needs for success is smart people that can come up with solutions so i believe computer programming is something that should be taught from early on in order to train young minds of course its not for everyone i know people who wont understand it no matter how they explain it to them but then again mindless memorizing is not for everyone either,positive

as a computer science major who will soon be working in nyc as a software engineer i agree with many of the points in this video my firstyear salary will exceed 100k after only a bachelors degree although this is due to a combination of several internships done during college the cost of living in new york and sheer luck and blessings many of my peers are also finding roles with great compensation if any high schoolers college students or even people out of school are considering learning how to code i strongly urge you all to make the leap,positive
one of my classmates from college was a former software developer he managed to break into the field without a cs degree but the company he worked for had to downsize they decided to lay off all employees who didnt have a 4year degree its an anecdotal example but having a degree in cs or a related field is a good investment for increased job security within such a volatile field of work,positive
doing my cs degree right now not gonna lie it sure aint easy but its definitely something i love doing,positive

its been 4 years since graduating with my computer engineering degree pay is amazing benefits are amazing flexibility is amazing the projects are usually interesting there are so many openings in computing there are so many business opportunities as well its absolutely insane i think companies are really really desperate for talent right now i got lucky ending up in silicon valley but there is no doubt in my mind that the degree is extremely lucrative anywhere in the developed world at my university computer engineering was 85 computer science 15 electricalelectronics engineering its functionally equivalent to computer science as far as the industry is concerned i chose to take robotics electives in school but dont actually use those skills in my job im just a standard software developerengineer haha i have a friend who went the boot camp route and struggled a lot in the field being the first target during layoffs and having to learn a ton of stuff that boot camps just dont cover with some tutoring and some years of onthejob training he is doing ok now too id definitely recommend the degree route as it lays the complete foundation and gives you the flexibility to learn about some of the more advanced specializations like machine learning artificial intelligence programming languages computer graphics game development distributed systems and more in a controlled learning environment with ample timing before jumping straight into the subset of the industry youre interested in,positive

a good video as always as a cs major myself this is actually finally a series where i can answer questions and stuff in the comment section just a pedantic note for people who want a little more info 1 there are also not versions of all the gates and or and xor become nand nor xnor respectively they are represented by adding a small circle to the end of the gate while they can be formed just by adding a not gate at the end of the inputs they are common enough that they get their own specialized parts you often here people verbally nand and xnor when talking about logic so i think it is interesting to note even though this isnt computer engineering 2 while by convention in truth tables 1 is true and 0 is false this is often not the case when we actually look at real components because of power usage the opposite is often used generally the more common output is set to 0 3 0 doesnt actually mean nothing is flowing through for example we may set our 1 to 5 volts and our 0 to 23 volts this allows for us to have an off state at 0 volts we wouldnt want our computer to be calculating stuff with 0s when it is off there are also other uses for this state but this may be covered in a future video,positive

i’m an excs and mathstats student who actually just switched his double major to actuarial science and mathsstats the reason being was because i found out that cs is only about 30 programming the rest of it is theory of cs and various other theoretical mathrelated cs courses like advanced algorithms and theory of computation which i’m personally not interested in if you really don’t find a lot of interest in algorithms data structures and theory of cs as viable as it is this major may most probably not be for you if you love programming but don’t find the indepth cs stuff interesting i’d encourage you to instead selfteach programming or go through a coding bootcamp computer programming is only a tool in cs like math is a tool in physics,negative
both are s or a tier degrees honestly so anyone who picks either of them will be fine great salary and job growth thanks for the videos as always shane,positive

here’s a story for you beginners i went into my first class of cse with no knowledge of coding i got a c in intro to java okay yeah i did bad but then i wanted to get better so i did some practice over the winter to improve my logic okay b in the next highest class the following semester software 1 then over the summer i was able to learn so many other languages swift python javascript i had all this growth in a little under a year all i’m saying is if you guys are worried about being a beginner who doesn’t know how to code and don’t think it will get easier trust me it gets easier do simple personal projects to help yourself get the flow of implementing your own logic in things like it else’s while for loops etc to help you gain a feel of how they work i would struggle on projects during the semester on how to make a blackjack game in java as a beginner this is a daunting task for me so over winter break i made projects such as modeling a car in java okay what functions does a car have accelerate decelerate break etc from then i could think of variables okay what could toggle a car being on or off oh a boolean oh maybe my car should run only when the gas level is greater than zero okay that’s loop there with gas level modeled as an int see things like this slowly helped my logic grow and now i can tackle any language or problem my class throws at me trust me i’m still a beginner as well but i ended up catching up to the kids around me when i was once behind and in times when you feel like giving up please don’t i urge you to stick through it because it does get easier,positive

on the first point i had been coding since 7th grade and i had plenty of classmates who hadnt coded ever when i started college for those of you in the latter position we dont judge your for not knowing programming we are glad you are trying to learn and many of us want to help you i love inviting friends over to my dorm and helping them out with assignments and group studying you dont need to be scared of us or embarrassed that you arent a flawless coder we arent either and the skill we have we had to put in work for as well and we want to help you get to that point as well were all at school to learn and if i can help others i will i hope once i get to upper division classes that those friends will help me as well when they inevitably get to a point where they are better than me at certain things you cant be the best at everything also for the book thing as a math major double majoring i have a nagging need to buy every book for every class they are expensive but it fills me with pure joy to have a library of math and cs textbooks in my room i am willing to skip on a game or two for a textbook both provide me with entertainment because i am weird lol,positive
here is my story i’m currently thirteen years old and have been programming for a year i started off with the basics of c for a few months then i moved on to python i’m currently a python intermediate and now i started learning java i think what kept me going was practicing and building my own projects i was fascinated by the cool games and projects i can create and that made programming even more enjoyable to me i would also recommend finding a coding partner or a coding club as suggested in this video because you can help each other out and build projects together i personally wasn’t able to find a coding partner of a coding club since not many kids my age know how to code,positive
hey man i just started my computer science journey at ucf about a month ago and i was wondering if you ever found a specific time during the day or night where you find yourself to be the most efficient with coding in other words do you have a time during the day where you just shut everything down and force yourself to just stop programming for the day or is it usually different for you every day i loved this video i really related to feeling pretty lost my first 2 weeks as i had no programming experience at all but am finally really starting to get the hang of things my professor for my intro to c class has been constantly repeating that 80 of the learning in this class will be outside of the classroom and i have found that to be some real truth,positive

good to have you back forrest ive been following you since i started chasing my degree i am now coming up on the completion of my associates in computer science and math from my community college and then transferring to a university to chase a bachelors i feel like i know barely anything about coding because all of my general education classes are so demanding did you feel this way i am really looking forward to only learning programming and computerfocused information because although i am finally in a java class chemistry 2 is kicking my ass and takes all my time thanks,positive
definitely wish this was made when i first started my degree the little bit and pieces of knowledge always manage to add up great video as always,positive
went through all of these during my first year at university i know it may seem complicated here or really difficult but it honestly isnt if you want to study cs or computer engineering or something like this dont let this keep you from doing that dont be afraid by thinking its going to be too difficult or whatever i promise its not,neutral
i dont even feel upset anymore for having my data stolen they earned it they win,neutral

high school students who want to go to stem majors in college should watch your videos you cover subjects indepth with practical examples this is what is lacking in the majority of careermajor prep videos on youtube the other channels would say you need to know math but are not really specific like you it would be interesting to know how many students saved time and money by not having to switch majors because they picked the wrong major in their freshman year thank you,positive

no question about it this guy is a genius the idea of using a physicsbased notion of time like that of relativity and using that as a metaphor to guide his work in distributed systems and its notions of timing is a really powerful and original way of thinking,positive
im not clever enough to understand the problems this man solved but am glad he did,positive
i am proud that i stumbled on it this statement itself says how humble he is,positive
this man did more for mankind than thousands of others did yet he is still humble but also wholesome and full of soul love it,positive
lamports turing award in 2013 was probably one of the most overdue turing awards glad to see his foundational work and the whole field better recognised with such an interview,positive
i feel like the most important thing hes said there is coding is to programming what typing is to writing if you learn to program by learning to code you essentially only know how to type this this is something i always try to convey but never found the right words for it ill be using that analogy for sure d,positive
it’s certainly a honour to hear about this amazing groundbreaking work but i am even more astounded by his humbleness and honesty hats off to you sir,positive
one of the markers of true genius is thinking in an interdisciplinary fashion in my opinion this man has demonstrated only in this short time that he has knowledge of art mathematics and physics its no surprise he contributed to our world in the way he has,positive

this ted talk encouraged me to go into computer science now im in my second year in college and i love it,positive
studying computer science is my dream due to circumstances i unfortunately couldnt study it i am still trying my best to learn a little about it through online courses while working,neutral
i think shes talking about software engineering education not computer science education math is an integral part of computer science because math is the language of science if you took math from computer science by definition you took science out of computer science which is quite bizarre,negative
wow this was amazing watching and would like my instructor to be like her she is to the point and understands that needing more programmers i am just getting started and it is all about problem solving,positive
computer science is a medium for problem solving and selfexpression ashely gavin i like her definition,positive
the first ted talk ive seen in years that was good even great there were some inaccuracies about cs but note that the vocabulary varies by region school and nation if definitions were your main takeaway then the video is not meant for you,positive
i did python tutorial after python tutorial and none of it ever stuck it wasnt until it really mattered at my job that i was pushed to learn basic computer science principles and not long after that python and i love every single part of it,positive
although she’s wrong about the math part i definitely believe that professors like to make learning cs harder than it should be,negative
update i switched my major to mathematics i guess cs was not for me xd,negative
it took me like 7 years to get my undergraduate i felt dumb all the time im glad pushed through im a data engineer and a lot of the stuff i found impossible before is easy now i graduated with a 25 gpa a lot of my teachers and the dean tried to convince me to change my major but i never gave up practice makes perfect,positive
the math shouldn’t scare you away i was terrible at math i just applied myself and made it not bad at all it just takes effort,positive
its 2019 theres no way youre bad at computers youve clearly never worked in tech support,negative
cs is combination of math physics statistics and algorithms there is a famous quote that computer science is as much about computers as astronomy is about telescopes,neutral
you lost me at mathheavy thank you for this information considering choosing another degree now,positive
im a first year cs student at a major german university and my current classes are introduction to programming computer architecture automata theory calculus and linear algebra i went into it not having a background in cs at all i really only went into it because i have a thing for logic and structure and i dont regret my decision at all at the beginning i was worried because i didnt know how to code at all and i had to put in some extra hours in the beginning compared to the kids who have been doing this since they were in infant but its totally possible,negative
a cs degree is basically a math major with some programming if you plan on taking cs make sure u actually enjoy it rather than doing it for the money,neutral
cs requires a person who is patient persistent creative in solutions basically not someone who sees a wall and says i am done thats how you can know further as you grow into cs you will find out that you have been taught how to solve any problem even if not from this field think research learn craft every experience that you go through will you improve at those steps you will graduatelly stumble across moments where you will be overwhelmed and its ok because you also learn that progress is through error after error only for the new problem to come to you and apply the same process you already can handle being overwhelmed,positive
to add to this cs is also a major for those who like to practice outside the classroom i am a current cs major at lawrence technological university and the majority of my programming practice came from implementing the techniques taught in class to personal projects outside of the curriculum i believe this is an important element to the cs degree path in order to get really good,positive
i cant believe this is free online to watch and learn you guys are doing great things i deafinetly want to be a computer scientist now,positive
this series is a great addition to learning computer science ie learning syntax logic algorithms it gives context to everything besides its fascinating,positive
small bug in pseudo code for selection sort at 311 third from bottom line should say swap array items at i and smallest currently it says to swap items at index and smallest since index would be at the end of the array whenever that line is executed as it is after the inner forloop this would swap the last and smallest elements rather than putting the smallest element in its correct position,neutral

ah yes the graph depthfirst vs breadthfirst search i also quite enjoyed the binary search tree bst really fascinating field of algorithms and data structures,positive
this video was incredibly well done this lady is really great at teaching material in a clear easytofollow manner,positive
ive always thought it interesting how differently sorting algorithms work to how we as humans seem to sort things it seems like were much more efficient than many of the algorithms at least the ones ive seen which is admittedly few for example when we look at all the items we remember what we saw before and can change more than one thing at once eg oh i remember that was the smallest before i found the actual smallest so thats the second smallest let me put both of them first and second right now saving myself a relook i know computers are still faster in the end but i suspect thats because we physically cannot write or move objects around as quickly as a computer can physically write data and possibly our brain has a slower clock speed rather than computational efficiency anyone know if thats true has anyone made a human sort algorithm so to speak that sorts the way we do including our little tricks im guessing no if not are there any algorithms that at least take advantage of a trick or two like the one i just described,positive
just a few things to note about the bigoh notation discussed in this episode in industry bigoh notation alone is what is seen when discussing algorithms however in academia it is a bit more in depth on is instead used to represent an upperbound in the worst case what is this problem or algorithm ωn pronounced bigomega is used to represent the lowerbound in the best case what is this problem or algorithm θn prounounced theta without the big is used to represent the tightbound used when the bigoh is equal to the bigomega which is the exact running time there is also small omega and small o but those are rarely used also we only care about the biggest polynomial when we use this notation so if a problem takes 5n4 3n2 1 to do we just say it is θn4 we drop the coefficient and smaller terms because we only care about what happens when n is really really big you may notice that earlier i mentioned algorithm or problem when describing the notation this is because the it is often used in academia to denote all of the algorithms that exist for a problem for example for matrix multiplication of an n x n matrix we have ωn2 since we know that we at least need to read in n2 values this problem currently has on23728639 which is the running time of an algorithm created by francois le gall in 2014,neutral

i had a tutor and a friend student that excelled in classes the tutor is doing well but my friend is now deceased beaten to death as a street person on drugs the tutor that helped me told me that the reason one goes to school is to learn to teach yourself if university does not teach you to teach yourself you have failed because if you cant teach yourself you can not teach others what you have learned i have this discipline in my agenda on full and have helped other students in the past,neutral
cant stress making more cs friends enough ,positive
as a college student this video was really great for me with everything happening due to covid19 it really slowly made me lose my desire to immerse in cs and i didnt fully realize it until i heard you say it thanks for all the advice you put out,positive

your videos are insane the amount of effort that goes into compiling all this information making it digestible for the average viewer and also having it be interesting on top of that the insane amount of editing and graphic work to make it coherent and fun to watch youre going places man love it,positive
i’m currently studying compilers and language design i make programming languages basically and your explanation of highlevel languages to assembly was very good it was simple and easy to understand i’m definitely yoinking it,positive
as a cs major this is amazing work i particularly liked the part about graphics rendering the explanations are not only consistently clear they are concise which is a nontrivial feat,positive

1038 just an extra note about using sha for passwords while it can be used its often not the best choice sha was designed to be fast to compute making it very useful for older hardware and things like signatures but you typically want the exact opposite for passwords for a password hashing algorithm you want it as slow as possible until it starts annoying users that way an attacker will be able to calculate fewer hashes per second while brute forcing as of right now the usual choices for password hashing are bcrypt or argon2id both of which were designed to be slow,neutral
as a computer science student i love the fact that theres no clickbait you know your topic and explain it very clearly you earned yourself a new subscriber,positive
crazy amount of info explained here we use these almost every day yet most people have no idea how they work,neutral
even knowing most of this information the way you simplify it and make it so clear is really impressive this is super well made and entertaining ,positive

ive been stuck in tutorial hell for so long at the moment i can code any mockup in html and css and javascript is a challenge i deleted every tutorial on my pc and decided to take this course week 0 blew my mind the problem solving approach is what i love it teaches you to problem solve and build things on your own,positive
strongly agree when i started my journey as a programmer cs50 was my first course and i learned everything online from net ninja tutorials w3schools clever programmers and so on now i am a mobile and web app developer yeah i can say it is possible to learn computer science without a degree and im self taught software engineer too buddy,positive
great video as a beginner programmer i agree with most things you say one unspoken rule of programming is to google everything you dont understand its simply the only way one learns,positive
i totally agree with him before joining this course i couldnt even attend a 50 min class in my uni with my full conscious but i attended their first class of approx 5 hours with full interest so if you want to learn python or web or ai or cs basics which he mentioned in the video do give them a try its worth it,positive
yes this is what was able to get me to wrap my head around coding for anyone thats getting deeper into learning web dev stuff i highly recommend scrimba it has a great problemsolving based approach to learning where you get small challenges constantly so you can come up with the solution by tying what youve learned together instead of just showing you the solution first theres also some really cool tech on their platform where you get a live integrated cloudbased coding environment with all of the source files for each challenge automatically updated as you go through the course so its very seamless and the video tutorial part of it is not a video but instead is a scripted live editing of the code in the text editor you can pause it at any time and directly edit the code thats being written during the tutorial,positive
first of all congratulations youve earned around 40 subs in the last 2 hours from 129k to 133k second of all i love your content and the fact that youve encouraged me and many others to take this course is amazing ive been doing frontend for 4 months now and sometimes i struggle with some programing concepts in javascript soim enrolling now,positive

dr chuck is a legend,positive
i did my undergrad in computer science and im finishing up my ms in computer engineering it always drives me nuts when people ask what i do and then assume either is just programming or software engineering i try to explain it like this computer science is centered around mathematicscomputational science and problem solving developing algorithms and optimization programming is just a means of applying mathematics and problem solving techniques to problems computer engineering is focused on the development and design of computer systems i always get a reaction to my code from the guys that took computerelectrical engineering as undergrads because they generally speaking are simply trying to make x thing work and i am trying to make x thing run as efficient as possible you can take several different paths to become a coder but theres very different mindsets developed across the different disciplines anyone looking at going to school for computer science should understand this you are learning to be a problem solver first coding is secondary anyone can learn to code but being a master problem solver is what will set you apart in life and your career if you go down this path you are going to be doing far more math than coding and at the end your undergrad you will realize you barely learned how to code you will have to spend countless hours after graduation learning coding concepts libraries and frameworks but those problem solving skills are what will allow you to put all of that to use i hope this helps someone understand what they are getting into,negative

programming can be incredibly creative and selfexpressive its just not taught this way in most colleges unfortunately like its unlocking the full power of a computer so you can make it do literally whatever you want also problem solving requires a lot of creativity and lateral thinking generally,positive
when i took my exams so i can get in a university i really wanted to study architecture or art however things didnt go well and my score was extremely low so i was left with a few options one of them was computer science and telecommunications and tbh despite the fact that i had zero interest in programming before i freaking love this major so much sure its hard and frustrating af but every day you learn something new and it feels so good when you run your code and it actually works,positive
andrew tanenbaum books on cs helped me a lot during uni years and sometimes during discussions at work but they give theoretical knowledge not practical applications,positive
my biggest tip if youre a computer science student and have the chance it was not required at my college to take software engineering make sure you take all the software engineering classes you can because thats what youll be doing most of cs is a lot of abstract data structures and ideas that you may never even ever use but knowing the pipeline of actually creating software and those different methodologies agile which is just old school rad with more crap to have to deal with waterfall spiral etc etc will give you a better idea of what youll be doing on the day to day youll tailor your data structure and algorithm knowledge to what youre tasked with at work but the software engineering portion youll use anywhere you go,neutral
this is so informative ive been a little on the fence about getting into cs but i love how challenging it is this video really helped answer alot of question i had i cannot thank you enough,positive
hey everyone after some years of experience i know by myself how difficult it can get when learning and optimizing programming skills a few days ago i had a very interessting nerdy conversation about this topic with a very good friend of mine who is also in the programming business for many years the question which fascinated me the most was how one could make the lives of programmer a lot easier the reason why i tell you this is because i am very exited about your opinion on this topicespecially the following 2 questions would interest me the most 1 as programmer what are were the 2 biggest issues you’re dealing with 2 regarding your programming skills what would you wish for more than anything else thanks so much in advance looking forward to reading your answers,positive
thanks great advice just starting out pursuing a ba cs after being out of school for 20 years i have been having a similar dilemma i originally signed up for software development but my counselor said i should do cs since i said i want the ability to be hands on on top of developing not sure if i am thinking too big but thanks great video,positive
to hear that you didnt have any preparation before college makes me feel better for being in the same position i really didnt have any experience with code other than html and felt behind because other student because half of them either smarter or extremely experienced with the area,positive
came for computer science stayed for the glorious hair and beard,positive
i go to odu so do you actually feel like you learned a lot in 350 i havent taken it yet but a lot of people ive talked to say its massively outdated and just a ton of busy work i understand that can help you practice discipline but was it useful any other way in getting ready for your career,neutral
so my university currently has both software engineering and computer science both majors are pretty much the same thing and the only difference is about 3 or 4 classes for example for the data structures and algorithms course there is cis 350 theory based and cis 3501 se side of the class also the core requirements has se majors take se 2 after se 1 while cs majors only take se 1 so its really the same degree same requirements only difference is a couple of classes that are very similar,neutral

tsp is a np hard problem but so is making this video every seconds of the video i see an exponential effort invested thank you so much,positive
in the 80s i used a different strategy to solve this problem just for my satisfaction i based my solution on the way nature would create an inner expanding bubble until touching all the nodes with minimal tensional energy i used basic in an 80286 pc with about 100 random nodes a short program with less than 100 lines of code was enough to get satisfactory results edit minor grammatical correction english is not my first language sorry for that,neutral
from the wikipedia page titled ant colony optimization algorithms they have an advantage over simulated annealing and genetic algorithm approaches of similar problems when the graph may change dynamically the ant colony algorithm can be run continuously and adapt to changes in real time this is of interest in network routing and urban transportation systems this reminds me a lot of the youtuber pezzzas work his ants simulation videos make sure to watch that it is analogous to the market speedrunning anything really,positive
been excited for this video for awhile i’ve heard of tsp superficially many times but never got a deep dive like this before very motivated exceptionally beautiful and naturally narrated content like this is the gem of youtube just to add as impossible as this problem is it’s wild to know we have a record solution with a tour length of 75 billion,positive
im quite impressed that you managed to avoid mentioning entropy while discussing the annealing approach and the pheromone approach i once tried to explain pheromone optimization to a friend of mine who wasnt familiar with using entropy to backtrack a search and i simply wasnt able to explain the process well done,positive
pspace problems common in planning are arguably harder as tsp is only nphard,negative
i did a report in linear algebra discussing using adjacency matrices to find paths from any point to any other point by raising matrices to their power step by step i managed to make it work for minimum hop count and shortest path between two points unfortunately it doesnt solve the tsp because it does not go back to it starting point only that it can hit every point we had another idea of using something similar to what we called gravitic weighting to image creating the shortest path by picking any point and then lifting it and seeing the other points fall based upon distance we ran into problems with pruning of ineffecient routes if we could identify routes that were not going to be used we think it would have worked unfortunately our advisor didnt seem to care to help us at all to him tsp was just an impossible problem and we were waisting our time,neutral

this is for some of you incoming freshman who may be worried about cs if u have never coded before i was a freshman data science major last year and i had never written a single line of code i got a c in my intro to java course and i was very disappointed as it was something i really want to pursue i was worried about my performance in the next course software 1 and if my grade would be lower i worked on my own projects to better understand the logic and i ended up finishing with an a in the next course and this was all over the course of one winter break now i’m making apps with swiftui and solving data science machine learning problems in python and this was all over the course of a year don’t be afraid if you struggle early on it’s a part of the journey,negative
my advice as someone who just graduated with a cs degree and was also a peer tutor is to take the time to do your work and understand the code that youre writing too many times i see people slap shit together and then wonder why it doesnt work,negative
im in 4th year of my cs studies right now unfortunatelly i needed to realize all of the stuff you mentioned on my own i feel like in some cases it can be a little bit late i just hope somebody would talk to me about this at the beggining i would say to all new cs students this will be harder than you think but the balance is the most important thing,neutral
i’m starting collegeuni this year in the computer science course this was so timely,positive
another thing ive found helpful as a cs major is to make sure to capitalize on those required gened classes subjects like history english philosophy etc having a spare 100level intro to x class in your workload during a tough quarter doing hours upon hours of javapython can really defray the pressure many of these are also just as good when taken online as well,positive
great tips i would also like to say that understanding logic is very important my professor really stressed this in my first programming class he said that he has interviewed graduates who got through their entire college career through trial and error i think that he is right unless you can explain every single piece of your code line by line you dont really understand the logic behind it in fact he makes us go to the lab and the ta asks us to explain our code line by line if we want the full marks on the assignment,positive
never say ill do it later when it comes to assignments and projects ill write some more tips later,neutral
another tip is to take your time dont force yourself into like 56 classes 4 classes 3 majors one elective would be your best friend,neutral
my advice get into your schools cs discords and class specific discords if they have them or make one if there isnt graduate and undergraduate students work together to give lots of resources for all students and it help a lot especially with what proffesors are good and bad they help with assignments and even answer general questions,positive
thanks again for the opportunity absolute pleasure working with you guys on this steven npe,positive

steven this video was awesome you clearly put a lot of preparation into your lessons and the slide visuals are top notch compared to most other cs educational videos you definitely earned a subscriber,positive
i failed my precalc class my first semester of college i did an easier math class the second semester and passed it im ready to try the precalc again even though i failed the class i learned that math is one of the most beautiful languages in the world math is great im not good at it by any stretch i will still conquer this though,positive
the reason sooo many fear and fail at math is not because it is hard it is because they treat it like the other basic education subjects think differently and know that you cannot succeed at math by studying night before remembering a few equations like dates in history class nor by just scrapping by office hours are the key to succeess yes but even more important than that you must complete all homework when due and dont ever give up on a single problem then you must practice practice don’t study only practice that way you don’t just know you have complete understanding about concepts much like pointing out a particular color in the room you should practice until you can look at any series of alpha numeric characters and be able to identify what it is asking and instantly knowing like identifying red letters s t o p means stop how to approach the problem and what equation formula etc to use tools in a toolbox baby,negative
calculus discrete math linear algebra is a must,positive
lmao just changed my major to cs and was nervous for the math portion then i realized i’m not actually that bad at math and i was making it seem worse than it was don’t know if that will change when the semester starts but i’m excited gotta say thank you forrest you’re the reason i felt confident in changing my major to computer science,positive
throughout my life i always viewed math as something negative and sucked at it however during freshman year of college i decided that computer science it is and started out taking basic math classes prealgebra currently i am taking precalculus and will go up to calc 2 what made me get to where i am is the mindset,neutral
its important to note that it also depends on your college some cs departments like the engineering department requires lot of math while others dont like arts and sciences,neutral
thanks for the video getting into my first math cs courses and its been challenging but youre absolutely right hard work is what helps you get better at math and understand concepts not memorize formulas,positive
this is a reall helpful video thanks considering i want to go into cs videos about your process to solving complex problems would be great since im doing pure math in school ,positive
hey forrest im starting as a freshman in a few weeks and im wondering what your thoughts are on pursuing a computer science degree online as apposed to a physical college any insight would be greatly appreciated,positive
i stumbled upon your page a few days ago and i must say its been the best learning experience in terms narrowing down specific areas to focus on excellent content,positive
kirby this year really is just the gift that keeps on giving,positive
this is really cool my only gripe is that it’s only 2 player local and not 4 when wireless and online are 4 playeralthough it’s likely frame rate issues hopefully they add 4 player local in the future but other than that the game looks like great fun,positive
finally a game that truly gets me on a spiritual level,positive
i love that elfilin already has stuff in this game forgotten land was just before this so i was really surprised to see the stage as well as the cosmetics,positive
i love the part when kirby is quickly eating the 50 strawberry cake i imagine all this fun stuff from “kirby’s epic yarn” when he couldn’t contain himself from a giant cake i don’t care either gotta love that cake,positive
i love how you can add “dream” in front of any regular object and make it a powerful kirby artifact,positive
ive seen art of foodbased abilities before but not traditional abilities in the style of foods it works unexpectedly well,positive

this looks pretty fun only big let down is it seems to only go up to two players in local splitscreen,positive
the pricing is really good here great job nintendo,positive
sonic can totally pull off more serious stories like in adventure 2 im glad theyre taking that approach with frontiers im optimistic about this one,positive
it seems like theyre actually going for a serious story this time i hope they manage to pull it off the cutscenes look so gorgeous and the areas do to i was pretty sold on playing this game but now im really excited also this comment is gonna be really dated depending on what the game is like when it comes out i guess itll be like my own little time capsule to revisit years later,positive
whether or not this sonic plays out to what we want it to be we should give thanks to the people that spend many hours developing this game looks great ,positive
im loving the cyberspace stages and story so far nice to see another island in this trailer too cant wait to get this at christmas maybe itll be one of the few games ive 100d,positive
i really really really hope they dont screw this one up like id like to actually hear good things about a mainline 3d sonic game made by sonic team thats actually good,positive
beautiful finally a new sonic game that does justice for the original series the first showcase was strange but this one is definitely better compared to the old one,positive
i cant understand why some areas look genuinely breathtaking then others are just floating disjoined rails and walls i dont understand how theres such a massive difference,negative
i always love when sonic is more serious instead of cracking jokes hopefully he takes things seriously in this game,positive
so… this actually looks good as long as egghead doesn’t come back as another villain pulling the strings looks promising,positive
finally a trailer that makes sonic frontiers look exciting,positive

the 3ds is probably my favorite system of all time with access to all ds games and the impressive digital library almost no other system library can compare the library isn’t only large it’s diverse there are bangers for every genre of game all of this is a portable package,positive
i recently started playing kid icarus uprising and apart from needing to take a few breaks to rest my hands i am shocked with how much fun im having with it and im bummed that there hasnt been a sequel made since then,positive
love the 3ds planet robobots true arena is one of the most satisfying challenges to overcome across all games would be 1 on my personal list great memories of playing smash run w friends while getting lunch or wutever else,positive
fire emblem became one of nintendo’s larger series thanks to the 3ds i don’t really play fates or sov anymore but i still find myself revisiting awakening love that game if you can step outside of your completionist mindset you’d probably love it,positive
i was surprised kid icarus uprising isnt on here i think its the best 3ds game its a true masterpiece yet again sakurai developed this game too and a lot of his games are gold hes a very hard worker and has high expectations for his games,positive
3ds just felt so special i didnt expect it but found myself really into pokémon sun and moon i think pokémon refresh was a huge addition to making me attached to my team and i found myself tearing up in a lst battle when my mismagus held on to the end for me i know it ruins the game for some people the pokémon holding on has a higher rate of stopping ko than the focus band apparently but dont quote me on that but for me it was just want i wanted as a jaded almost30 year old who really just wanted to enjoy the game,positive
smash on 3ds was a marvel in its own right the fact the 3ds could handle it and at 60fps on the og 3ds was absolutely mind blowing to me for the time,positive
my favorite series is the dillon’s rolling western series i remember going on the eshop to find the last ranger being advertised however i wouldn’t get it until i grew up a bit more dillon’s character stood out when i am already attracted to stylized games all three of the games are tower defense where you are trying to clear waves as fast as possible currently all of the games are exclusive to the eshop unless you live in a pal region those games will be lost to time,positive
kid icarus uprising is my favourite game of all time the combat is fun the weapons are cool the characters are funny and layered and the story and world building is fantastic its been half the time there was between the last two games in the series but i will gladly wait another 10 years to get more kid icarus goodness,positive
i know this will get overlooked but i really wanna give props to the announcer she did a fantastic job and put so much energy into the announcement it honestly made me pretty hyped,positive
for those who didn’t notice the store manager for the locker items is harmony a character that has actually been somewhat present before in the series she’s part of the musical band known as chirpy chips that plays all sorts of battle music in splatoon 2 if you look it up she’s right there on the album cover,neutral
i love how the splatoon colour themes are based on complimentary colours opposite colours for example… splatoon 1 orange and blue splatoon 2 pink a green splatoon 3 yellow and purple some of the colours are slight variations such as pink it’s meant to be red but pinks a good substitute,positive
for those who have questions about this direct 1 you can actually skip the news this time 2 salmon run can be played at any time 3 in rainmaker there are multiple checkpoints now,neutral
i’ll always love splatoon they never take away things that people have always liked and instead they either make it better or add on things we’ve wanted i’m just really obsessed because i’ve always loved this game since i was little,positive
whoever this announcer was definitely needs a raise everything was so easily digestible and i’m glad new players can find their way even easier she sounded so energetic intrigued and passionate overall this 30 minute direct was beautifully executed,positive
im going to miss the idols from splatoon 2 they slayed perfect character design and wonderful personalities i didnt expect we would get three idols big man shiver and frye they seem to have a lot of potential im looking forward to doing story mode too the gameplay must be amazing,positive
i was genuinely afraid i thought the game would be identical to the second or even worse but this direct definitely made me change my mind there are crazy news the setting is much more oriental than that of previous games and i love it new weapons story mode that feels spatial practically a free choice of character customization of much more i have no negative comments the only flaw could be a short duration of the story mode which for lone players like me could be a problem but i sincerely hope im wrong ,positive
the expressions of the characters are perfect and everything looks so lively like the inklings have actually remade civilisation but no humans nintendo doesnt just cease to be awful they dont know how to,positive
the announcer here and on the direct is so good she sounds so energetic and passionate and it fits the game really well and gets me excited to play even more i am so unbelievably hyped up for this game omg i’ve been a fan of splatoon one but i didn’t get a hold of the game until splatoon 2 cause i was poor lol i legit can’t wait to play this every day,positive
i’m definitely interested to see harvestella shown off the concept sounds really cool but the trailer left me with very little idea as to how it would actually work so i’m interested to see more,positive
itd be nice that even when digital takes over for games that they offer a buy from the manufacturer option where you could order a physical copy online and get it shipped from wherever they made the game because i fully expect digital merchandise to be abusedcapitalized in some way out of favor for the consumer,neutral
for these kinds of shows i think id prefer a rapidfire series of announcements in 3060 minutes followed by a lengthier presentation going indepth into specific games that way those that are interested in a specific title can check out the deepdive of that game in specific after the main presentation,neutral
wanted to wish everyone a happy wednesday today love watching your video game news everyday jon keep up the great work ,positive
i am actually kind of looking forward to harvestella its a very pretty game,positive
the fact that the version of re7 that came out was considered marketings worst nightmare shows you that listening to marketing people is a foolish idea when it comes to creative endeavours,negative
after seeing that new splatoon 3 spawning cannon thing for the tenth time i just realized it’s how the developers wanted to tackle spawn camping which was a nightmare in the prior games,neutral
gamescon had quite a few games that peaked my interests but that sony edge controller was the most intriguing looks like we can hot swap joysticks which could be a fix to combat drift,positive

i am highly interested in the megaman collection some of my favorite gba games ever return to monkey island could be interesting and just hearing the music is really nice i like the style but its a pretty big change from what im used to seeing kenta looks really charming and adorable i adore the concept dragon quest treasure seems like a real blast i love being able to fight alongside companions it makes me miss dragon quest monster joker theres a lot of promise coming up but nintendo please it was a huge 3ds hit please remaster or remake tomodachi life,positive
nintendo just put out a better sonic trailer than sega did this should have been the first trailer for the game it makes so much more sense than the weird rollout sega did,positive
this might be in the running for the best direct ever so little downtime each announcement was ranging from cool and not my thing to wow,positive
thank you for finally putting persona 5 on the switch i have been waiting,positive
i do quite like how the splatana feels like a samurai stealth based ninja weapon diversifies the gameplay quite a bit,positive
wellworded and gracefully honest it does like quite the quality title im excited as a hardcore splatoon fan i have 670 hours on 2 so small changes still do mean a lot to me after playing the second game for the past 5 years of course it doesnt hurt to want just a little bit more for a sequel im hoping that future additions to the game will help it to become even better,positive
the power eggs always had a use you could buy weapons and upgrade them using the power eggs within the single player,neutral
the graphics actually look a lot smoother more intricate and more polished as well as the frame rate and overall flow of movement which is super nice i wasnt expecting a graphical improvement after the first footage we saw but now im happy,positive
i wasnt really expecting any new formula for the single player im completely fine with the stuff you mentioned maybe theyll explore new things in the paid dlc from the trailers ive seen your gameplay you get shot onto the stage for turf wars anarchy battles thus getting rid of team specific spawn areas perhaps thats what made the maps feel bigger cant wait to see how they update the splatoonsplatoon 2 stages,positive
i guess in terms of a single player mode for splatoon 3 i was hoping for a bowsers fury type of world where it feels more grand some exploration and seemless transitions into the levels,positive
i feel like the biggest sell for splatoon 3 is the timing with the switch being as old as it is now most people have a switch in their home so for kids this is a big buy especially if you havent played it yet but all your friends are playing it i havent played in a few years and im really excited just to chill enjoy all it has to offer along with the community surrounding it its a lot easier to sell this game to a japanese audience as well because of all the marketing and promotional events after the game comes out as well as the irl concerts with their in game idols,positive
my biggest hope for splatoon three is to get it and have fun playing through the waves of content as they tend to be fun and hype as they come out that being said for outsiders of the community i’m disappointed and really wish that it gives enough to entice new fans and not just old ones,neutral
i honestly hope its great considering that splatoon is my personal 2nd favorite nintendo franchise behind mario,positive
i am living for the revolutionary joke gonna be giggling about that for a while great breakdown and honest feedback,positive
this looks much better than the first wave waluigis pinball and mushroom gorge make the whole expansion worth it,positive
i remember trying to pass the first pinball in waluigi pinball as a young kid the feeling of accomplishment you got from beating it too the ramp where it falls was great definitely one of my favorite tracks the pinball machine segment the most chaotic place in any track that gets more chaotic every lap which may be why it’s so popular,positive
i’m literally hyped for this wave they have waluigi’s pinball i do find it interesting that they are also creating completely new tracks as well like the sundae one as most people suspected complete remakes of the originals all in all i’m excited,positive
i cant watch this without a huge smile on my face wave 2 looks incredible i still cant believe nintendo is bringing back 48 courses spanning the entire mario kart series and updating them for mk8dx its like a dream so many great memories with the originals ,positive
116 my favorite course from mario kart ds cant wait to race on it this thursday ,positive
looks amazing waluigi pinball had some electrodrome thrown in,positive
015 sky high sundae new 044 kalimari dessert n64 050 mario circuit 3 snes 055 mushroom gorge wii 101 sydney sprint tour 117 waluigi pinball ds 152 snow land gba 159 new york minute tour,neutral
i think i noticed a pattern cup 1 a tour city track paris and new york a standard track that exists toad circuit and mario circuit 3 an old school classic choco mountain and kalimari desert a mega fan favourite coconut mall and waluigi pinball cup 2 a tour city track tokyo and sydney an unexpected forgotten track shroom ridge and snow land a track with bouncy platforms sky garden and mushroom gorge a tour track probably originally made for mk8 or vice versa ninja hideaway and sky high sundae,neutral
this wave looks amazing im amped to play these and relive the past once again i hope they bring koopa cape and peach gardens along the future waves those 2 tracks especially are my favorite tracks to run,positive
these courses have made an already 5 star game even better it’s great they’re including one allnew course per wave too i’d love to see some new battle courses at some point though…,positive
vou comprar o meu nintendo switch esse ano esse canal tem me ajudado e me animando cada dia mais ,positive
melhor canal sobre nintendo do brasil parabéns coelho continue assim,neutral
tenho certeza que esse switch vai ficar bonito adoro vídeo de modificação do switch coelho  nintendista sem nintendo switch ,positive
achei que fosse um switch do kirby mesmo mas apesar do oled branco ser lindo esse do kirby também ficou lindo parabéns aí finalmente a mary aparecendo em mais vídeos ,neutral
ficou muito bonito o switch agora é hora de ver o vídeo do melhor casal nintendista,positive
comprei meu nintendo switch tem mais ou menos 2 semanas achei seu canal a pouco mais de 1 mês e cara tô amando seu conteúdo coelho parabéns,neutral
tô esperando lançar o switch oled nacional pra eu comprar ele  não vejo a horaaaaa quero muito jogar,positive
tudo que é do kirby é bonito é impressionante,neutral
eu tenho uma pequena inveja do tanto de personalização bonita que tem pro oled eu só tenho o switch v1 e o lite e ainda não achei personalizações tão bonitas quanto as do oled twt,neutral
tem umas capinhas que é só de encaixe melhor que esses adesivos assim se enjoar só tirar ou comprar outro case eu tenho um do zelda bem legal,neutral
im honestly super excited for this game to come out the new fusion mechanic looks crazy the story looks engaging it just looks like a very fun time heres hoping the game thrives edit apparently auto correct likes strives better than thrives,positive
this looks insanely good and the battle system with all its complexities makes me go tingly all over i spend so many hours learning all the different blades and how to utilize them in battle in xeno 2 can’t wait to get my hands on this new system it looks super interesting,positive
what i love about the xenoblade series is their integration of their battle mechanics and story line it hits different,positive
this game looked really good i’m a non xenoblade fan and checked out this direct and i gotta say it genuinely got me interested in the series i’ll definitely check this out if i can buy this game,positive
this looks amazing its my most anticipated game of the year xenoblade 2 was such a masterpiece and i cant wait for the next chapter the new battle mechanics look so sick and their is so much variety edit was expecting a typical nopon voice didnt expect riku to sound like such a chad ,positive
i feel like this is nintendos version of the final fantasy series i hope the xenoblade chronicles continues to expand this will surely keep me busy for a long time,positive
ill never get tired of watching this masterpiece direct the game has so much content plus the interlink mechanic is just insane they definitely incorporated a truly amazing mechanic after the driverblade one in xc2 monolith truly never dissapoints,positive
this really feels like a perfect blend between all three previous xenoblade games in terms of gameplay artstyle and world features im starting to really feel it,positive
this looks like the most complex battle system i have ever seen layer after layer of options i am giddy after each function shown i cant wait to play this i will have to buy it and play,positive
i think xenoblade might be becoming the best jrpg franchise and this game might cement that,positive
c’est trop bien j’ai vraiment hâte que je jeux sortent et de vous voir en vidéos dessus ,positive
ahah vous êtes chanceux  bientôt le splatfest ,neutral

well im sure this will end up well lol,positive
i hope one day people understand gabe newell once said the easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work its by giving those people a service thats better than what theyre receiving from the pirates truer words are yet to be spoken amidst this industry,positive
questions does the drm appy to anything played on the switch or just some upcoming titles do i need an internet connection to play on the switch im always connected so i had no idea this might be the case will drm make the switch unusable in another console generation or two,negative
this is part of why i stick with the older consoles all these servers network logins and drm stuff just ruins gaming for me i just like popping the game in and playing,negative
it will probably not be an online check drm i saw a flash of a website in the video on emulation piracy drm denuvo probably thinks that they have a way for a game to be able to run a check to see if its running in an emulated environment based on their history using kernelmode drm anticheat bs on the pc i would avoid any switch game running anything from denuvo,negative
the thing with drm like denuvo is that it literally pushed piracy more ive had a couple of friends with re 8 on pc that literally got the pirated version downloaded just cause it performs 100x better and for me personally i bought the ultimate version of dying light 2 i really enjoyed it but i had to lower settings cause i thought my pc couldnt handle it or something but then i tried out the cracked version and then all of a sudden the game runs like butter i hate denuvo and if used frequently on switch it will ruin games and even trust from the fanbases,negative
its also worth noting that the primary assumption behind drm is that people that would pirate a game if theres no drm would legally buy the game if theres drm thats a really absurd assumption most people that are actually doing the pirating would otherwise not buy the game at all so their piracy has a net zero impact on the developer and drm gets cracked in only a few months so the pirates need only wait anyway drm does only one thing and thats punish the people that legally buy the game,negative
the eff is what i said immediately denuvo does not stop piracy it kills game performance,negative
thats exactly what switch games need something to hinder the performance and bog stuff down brilliant,negative
man every year that passes im feeling more and more vindicated in emulation and archiving,positive
get the games here nintendo switch sports  animal crossing new horizons  splatoon 2 ,neutral
with the amount of people obsessed with nostalgia these days no one will actually be nostalgic in a few years,negative
pikmin 3 12 are already nostalgic just waiting for 4 to come out and 3 to become nostalgic,positive
i agree about splatoon 2 being nostalgic even though ive only been playing since march 2022 when u beat the game it feels so good too hear fresh start by the squid sisters,positive
ain’t no way he said nintendo switch sports is gonna be nostalgic,neutral
you cannot forget super mario odyssey the music just gives me shivers,neutral
botw is also gonna be nostalgic ,positive
the hype around super smash bros ultimate is something i will never forget it,positive
the game i’m already nostalgic for is botw hearing the theme and watching the trailer just gives me chills,positive
nostalgia is a very personal thing that being said i dont ever see myself being nostalgic for nintendo switch sports,negative
here’s our revisit review of lego star wars with patch 107 hopefully this helps anyone looking for latest information on the nintendo switch version through our all patched up format mark,positive
the fact that you revisit some patched games is one of the things i love most about your channel while i’ll say that many games should not release in the poor state that they do such is the state of the gaming world in 2022 you guys do all of a wonderful service by updating your reviews when possible thank you,positive
it’s easy to be harsh on the switch and the way some ports perform but it’s amazing to have full games like this on the move when developers get it right it really sings,positive
this is why i love this channel they don’t just abandon games at a review,positive
i suppose its because i grew up when all video games had pop in so it doesnt really create a negative connotation for me with a game i know that if a game isnt wholly designed for the switch that issues can occur with frame rates pacing and the like but it is always nice to see when developers continue to work on and iron out the problems with their games i think the patch was needed and accomplished what it was supposed to,positive
a note for your souldiers revisit while the patch fixed a lot of the worst issues the fire temple a late game area is still prone to a lot of crashing when saving at dragon swords it was 5050 every time i saved in that dungeon whether it would crash or not didnt get any crashes anywhere else so im not sure why that area specifically is so problematic it was also an area where one room in particular had a game breaking performance bug before the big patch,negative
i preordered this and i didn’t really notice much of the original issues but i think that’s because i was just enjoying the gameplay and i was mainly playing handheld on an oled but it’s always good to see developers going back and fixing things to improve the game,positive
glad the performance has gotten better on split screen i stomached it the first time through but might return to mess around knew this game had potential on the switch,positive
there’s so many things that annoyed me about this game and i ended up quitting well before completion i really like games with tight responsive controls where you can learn techniques to have complete mastery over your character’s move set this game was like the opposite to that ,negative
i nearly got 100 completion with this game had to stop after more than a couple of side quests had a weird performance issue where it would stutter beyond belief it took a lot of patience but if you could finish the quest the stuttering stopped it was frustrating usually they were quests where you had to find things that were all around a planet so you had to traverse large areas trying to do so when every input took several seconds to respond was too much for me now im stuck on some backlog games so i dont know if ill ever have 100 completion but maybe one day,negative
im so glad that the direction theyre going with when it comes to chaos is pure expression and a sense of warmth rather than falling into the trap of being edgy,positive
it almost sounds like a blend of indian japanese and brazilian culture which really brings out the idea of diverse unity and expressionism that chaos is all about i love it,positive
i absolutely love how chaos is used instead of being like an apocalypse or something the chaos is presented as a huge jumble of culture love it,positive
whoever mixed this song is a genius they managed to fit so many cultures in such a small amount of time and managed to perfectly make fake squid language sound great all whilst making a genuinely slapping song,positive
don’t get me wrong the concert vibe from the other games was cool but this fees like a whole festival and its really refreshing,positive
shiver’s part sounds like traditional japanese songs big man’s part sounds like a bit of brazilian funk maybe frye’s part sounds like it’s traditional from middle eastern and the chorus sounds like samba i’m in love with this song,positive
i love the music but another thing i noticed is how different every idol’s dance was they had their own unique way of dancing according to their culture and it makes me so happy to see a mashup of multiple cultures in one performance,positive
the only bad thing about this song is that it ends,negative
not sure if anyone else had noticed this but when i rewatched this again i saw that the platforms that shiver frye and big man were standing on actually connect together the bottom part makes up a fish shiver’s platform is the head big man’s the middle part and frye is the tail very subtle detail i love it,positive
i love all the other idol songs but i gotta say this song is the one that feels the most like a celebration it has a cultural festival quality to it,positive
merci jvm toujours au top grâce a vous 3 dead island sur série x pour moins de 6 eur c génial merci pour le tuyaux,neutral
cyberpunk 25 euros en version ps5 et métro exodus pour 750 version ps5 également ,neutral
malheureusement cest toujours les mêmes promos et les mêmes prix cest soulant a la longue sur le ps store les prix sont gonfler pour faire croire a un eventuel promo il y a 1 mois metro exodus gold edition a 999 euro et la le jeu seul a 1049euros,negative
c’est quoi le jeu à la fin de la vidéo si c’est bien un jeu,neutral
très belle vidéo le son et limage est waou moi aussi jai une chaîne où je parle de linfo du jeux vidéo passer faire un tour,neutral
sympa loffre pour les joueurs autre que sony pour sabonner à votre magazine,neutral
on parle trop de sony et peut de microsoft ,negative
ac odyssey un des meilleur assassin’s creed ,negative
le pire ac de lunivers cest un des meilleurs assasin cest sur quil a jamais touché ac,neutral
dead island definitive edition avec le live gold sinon pas promos ça serait sympa de le préciser sinon il y a des promos vraiment meilleures sur xbox et sans xbox live cest comme dire jeux gratuits sur consoles sans mentionner quil faut le ps plus ou le gamepass pour ça je met un pouce vers le bas mais personne ne le verra ,neutral
now to get ready for gamescom,positive
im way more excited to see harvestella than i am for splatoon 3 so im happy theyre going to show it off,positive
im not too worried nintendo usually does a direct on september since 2016 they need a september direct to promote stuff in time for the holliday season when people get new switches,neutral
i just read that vr is actually beneficial for eyesight it was an article about some new prescription glasses tech out of japan that uses the same science with how vr headsets seem to improve nearsightedness or prevent at least it from worsening as if i needed another reason to abandon my entire life for vr lol,neutral
very excited for psvr2 gonna feel like that big leap in graphics that flat games dont really have anymore because of diminishing returns,positive
not necessarily if a september direct came out in the middle or near the end of september it makes sense that it wouldn’t cover the already released splatoon 3 and i don’t see harveststella gameplay coverage as something that would have gotten significant coverage on a general direct either,neutral
i actually like that you keep it real and don’t scream and shout it’s gets a bit scripted and i feel some people do it for the younger audience which is like the equivalent of offering them candy to get in a van,positive
4616 let’s just appreciate how they always manage to put a smile on our faces whenever we feel negative ,positive
remember that nintendo treehouse works with localisation and translation of games and this is what they are working on at the moment,neutral
i want to get disced games so i can play them in 20 years but for the rest ye i agree id still get a ps2vr for under 1k knowing sony theyll charge a price thats competitive but makes them money i think about 500600 but im sure they did their research and went with what they thought makes them the most money,neutral
what do you think are we getting closer to a price range you could see yourself grabbing something like this use code beatemups to get 5 off for your first sakuraco box through this link and tokyotreat box through this link,neutral
honestly the design is pretty nice looking and damn that controller looks so sleek love the white on the console and controller too,positive
i like the lights under the joycon control sticks thats what stood out to me the most it really is a nice looking console,positive
this convinced me that the switch pro controller needs an all white version because that controller looks so nice,positive
the biggest advantage the aya air has over the steam deck is the steam deck isnt available in all countries and regions to buy and this should be so people have the option to get this,positive
hmm id still go with the steam deck this is more expensive and looks like it performs worse the only thing going for it is the oled screen plus i think the steam deck will last longer with its powerful hardware and valves continued support plus im not sure how to feel about aya neo they release a new console every 6 months which makes me question their dedication to support in the long run and they were way too expensive and probably only brought the price down on this new one because of the steam deck edit should probably finish watching the video before writing a comment because you said pretty much everything i said haha,negative
just to note gulikit also makes joystick replacements for the steam deck i saw ltt install it not too long ago and recently picked me up a pair,neutral
its always a good day when a new beatemups video is published,positive
i’m in the same boat i exclusively play portably now so much so that i don’t touch my ps4 anymore i’m entirely on the switch i dreamt of having the yakuza series being portable and working well… but with options like the aya neo steam deck i can have that love this new generation of portable gaming it’s insane,positive
wood thanks for reviewing this and introducing me to a new controller i know you were mainly focusing on the mini streamdeck but still i had never heard of it and i was looking for something like that because believe it or not my pro controllerjoycons all have stick drift so finding a controller that addresses that problem is exactly what i needed especially when its got gyroscope capabilities too i play splatoon so i need gyro and sticks with no drift of course,positive
honestly that tricolour three team mode was what sold the game to me its just a shame that its limited to splatfests only i felt like as a mode that was the truly unique and franchisepushing idea of a mode that warranted a whole sequel oh well i guess nintendos servers wouldnt be able to handle it at the moment this is just what splatoon 2 should have been back in 2017 to me splatoon really needs to evolve beyond the first game in quite tremendous or advanced ways in order to actually feel like a true sequel the tricolour mode was close to that principle but alas its only limited to splatfests otherwise stay fresh is just a quote of sheer irony because splatoon has thus far to me not proven to stay fresh,negative
the person who came up with all the fish puns seriously deserves a raise,neutral
the locker feature the ghost feature and everything else looks so exciting can’t wait for this game,positive
a lot of folks were hoping for an apartment they could decorate and i feel like the locker feature is a good way to address that without distracting too much from the main game,positive
thank god we can finally just queue up with friends on the same team that was the main thing keeping my friends and i from playing more,positive
so many quality of life upgrades gameplay upgrades and things the fanbase has been asking for have now been included this game truly is set apart from splat 2 thank you so much nintendo and splat3 dev team you all did amazing ,positive
the replay feature is actually pretty fire,positive
i already know i’m gonna pull something from dancing to these new songs cant wait to play against everyone as team rock amazing job nintendo,positive
this game is looking fresher than grocery store produce i love the new aesthetic and weapons plus the new features look really fun i also love how you can customize your character with emotes and lockers it fits perfectly with splatoon,positive
only in splatoon games they keep making the foreheads bigger,neutral
3 years later still watching without having one,neutral
i just watch unboxing vids to get that mental high of experiencing something new without actually splurging for it,positive
i remember being so giddy and excited for this thing to come out watching videos unboxings gameplay etc seeing this video again brings back some really great memories,positive
this is amazing no confusing instructions no details missed except the one were how you take the little controls off and the cool thing is that you didnt stutter it doesnt matter but its just amazing how your explanation went,positive
i own a ps4 but i suddenly have the urge for one of this the red and blue design looks great,positive
my brothers have one of each of these and i use them sometimes the only problem weve run into with them is the joycons bugging out with the display he has had to send them in twice for that and they still get that problem but other than that its a great system for us,positive
the back is not for speakers its the intake vents for cooling the system and the fan does actually run in handheld for games like zelda,neutral
keep in mind this was 2 years ago nintendo has improved and updated all of the mistakes and frame rates,neutral
very clear and thorough thank you,positive
hey just wanted to let u know what an amazing job u did explaining everything this helped me a lot,positive
bon visionnage à vous   pensez au petit pouce  sous la vidéo  essayez le  sous la video ya une nouvelle animation ça aide la chaine la gamescom en direct ce soir sur ma chaine stream  vous pouvez aussi aider la chaine par ici  ma chaîne secondaire,neutral
coucou jadore tes vidéos je te suivais au début par rapport à mes enfants maintenant je me suis mise à jouer à splatoon avec ma fille et comme toi car jadore lunivers hp jattends ardemment que le jeu soit sorti je crains néanmoins la sortie sur switch peur que cette version sois moins jolie je vais me tourner vers la version pc je crois bonne journée,positive
salut emb je voulais savoir si la version deluxe sera aussi au format physique pour l’accès anticipé de 72h car j’ai fais des recherches sur internet et j’ai vue que l’édition collector a le droit à un accès anticipé je pence que les gens qui commande le collector recevront un mail avec un code pour l’accès de 72h du coup je me posé la question si ils allaient faire pareil avec la version deluxe au format physique enfin si elle existe…,neutral
merci edouard pour ces précisions très précises du coup je pourrais le préco demain sur ma xbox série s merci de ta réponse nayko,positive
jai hâte de jouer à ce jeux jespère quil va bien être optimisé sur switch,neutral
je pose ma question avant de finir la vidéo mais je voulais quand même ton avis sur le prix de la collector je suis un énorme fan de la licence et je sens que je vais prendre la collector mais quand même elle est pas hyper chère et sinon coucou quand même ahah ,neutral
il faut reconnaître que tu es le youtuber qui publie le plus de vidéo à la journée… respect et force à toi confrère gamer et passionné ,neutral
merci pour toutes ces informations très riches ,positive
le jeu se passe en fin 18001890 on le sait depuis le début et c’est la révolution des gobelins par contre les grosses araignées font quoi dans la forêt aragog et hagrid sont pas à poudlard très chelou comme clin d’œil même si on peut se dire c’est juste des araignées géante autre que l’espèce d’aragog,neutral
jétais chaude pour me prendre le collector mais vu le prix ça va être compliqué je vais essayer déconomiser pour essayer de lacheter sinon tant pis,neutral
f for mr satoru iwata thank you may your soul rest in peace,positive
this f is for respect not only to a great man but to the man who made a ton of nintendo games possible rip,positive
rip mr satoru iwata for such a amazing console,positive
you did a great job just got mine oled version and it was amazing f for mrsotaru iwata rest well legend ,positive
just got my oled model over two weeks and i personally like mines a ton been taking good care of it best gaming console ive own to date ps f for mr satoru iwata,positive
ok i think there were only 3 secrets the golf and weird home screen sounds i didnt know about and the internet thing is pretty niche but the rest of these should be known by anybody who has recently played their nintendo switch for at least 5 hours,neutral
rip iwata i was so sad when he died he was the face of nintendo what a loss but his ideas gave the greatest success to the company and helped them move forward,positive
dark mode was the first thing i check in the settings lol  everything is dark mode for me if it is possible lol,positive
rip iwata a legend never forgotten,positive
rip iwata a true legend ,positive
still happy with my original at the minute i cant compensate paying for the upgrade personally but fully understand why you would go for it as a first time switch buyer,positive
its a bit expensive and i didnt want to buy it as i have the original but my husband bought it for me as an early christmas present and i was able to transfer and re download my stuff overall im really happy with the oled version it feels more sturdy and the graphics are much better i was able to sell my original switch so we got quite a bit of our money back so i say its definitely worth it ,positive
it looks neat the screen looks slightly bigger and it looks like a quick cash grab if u have the original switch and the switch lite i love playing the switch on table top mode with the switch pro controller it feels more comfortable and it gives u that lil home console feel,positive
thank you you just gave a good review unlike the stereotypical reviews that only bring up the its just a larger screen and thats it reviews that are bandwaggoning trash so thanks very much for this you brought up a few things i didnt yet know about it ,positive
picked up on oled and very happy with the bigger screen size paired with my hori split pro joycons its feels greatthe stock joycons feel small and uncomfy the screen for my old switch looks like an old cheap tablet now with that huge bezel if you have no fingernails the cart door is way harder to open than the old switch door,positive
is it just me or was the original switch more creaky when holding it than the oled the oled seems incredibly solid not sure if it just loosens overtime,neutral
i have the v2 but i do think the oled is nice i like how it has ethernet supportand i hear it has a padded dock now which they should of done from the beginning but oh well i play only on my tv so i won’t be upgrading until a whole new system drops but i give the oled a 910def worth it for new switch buyers imo,positive
the card slot is way harder to open on the oled sucks for people like me with short fingernails never had this issue with the original so its baffling as to why they changed it,negative
love my oled such a premium experience compared to the original,positive
if nintendo makes another switch i really hope they make the joycons bigger and more ergonomic,positive
i think the freechoice gym makes sense because in the pokemon world there are trainers who start their journey from towns or cities more advanced than the first village of the main character imagine if every npc started from pallet town that wouldnt make much sense right,neutral
these presents are really what all people need and love thank you so much,positive
my man toby fox did the unimaginable yet again i cant believe he made the music for the raid battle lets gooo 1720,positive
some cool improvements here though i still think the gem forms are a little silly would love to just get mega evolution back those were awesome,positive
this game seems to have a lot going for it three storylines sounds like great idea at least on paper as it would give both fans that want a more traditional pokemon game and those who want something fresh,positive
onix better be in scarletviolet……the dream of having a crystal onix must come true,positive
i feel like the hill to climb after arceus is huge i really liked the independence aspect of the game the catching mechanics that didnt require you to battle and no forced encounter in tall grass which allowed you to see the wild pokémon these new games seem to have kept some of these so im eager to find out how it will pan out,positive
1997 legendary pokemon are elusive to find and even more difficult to catch usually only obtainable after finishing the main game nonstop rumours about dubious methods for how to obtain them underneath trucks etc 2022 vvvvrrroooommmmm,negative
the new terastal gimmick looks awesome,positive
i’m just happy that gogoat is finally in another game such an under appreciated pokémon,positive
lets not deny this guys despite the wii u being a huge commercial failure it had a great library of games its a huge shame the console itself didnt do very well,negative
despite its terrible sales the wii u made up a huge part of my childhood and i loved it,positive
brings back so many memories of my early childhood to now i remember when i was very little i had the n64 where i first played mariokart then i was later given as a present the game boy and then i remember later on i wanted the gamecube which i got i think either for my birthday or for christmas and that’s where i first played animal crossing i played the other versions on the other systems as well i then asked about a year or two later santa for a blue ds lite and a few years later i got the ds i xl which was a surprise present from my grandma and when i graduated from middle school my grandma got me the wii as a graduation present i eventually also got the 2ds only because it was slightly cheaper and now i have the nintendo switch i still love them all and nintendo to this day animal crossing super mario bros mariokart mario party and all the other classics are still my favorite to this day and i can’t wait to see super nintendo world when it opens at universal studios,positive
thank you nintendo for making our childhood memorable i once owned gb color and nintendo ds and i had so much fun back in those days,positive
thank you for this video now whenever nintendo talks about how much of a family friendly company they are similar to what sakurai said when he was introducing terry bogard for smash im going to remind them that they once were a love hotel,positive
glad nintendo is still fighting in the console bussiness despite their ups and downs over the years the gaming world is benefited so much with nintendo in than without,positive
this is probably my favorite game company thank you for making this,positive
considering the games releasing for other major consoles its amazing how nintento still holding its possition as one of the big 3,positive
what does take time to appreciate how much nintendo put into the conslas and still makes it family friendly,positive
fun factthe success of nintendo switch can be attributed to several factors that have come together in favor of the console its hybrid capabilities allow it to appeal to a wide customer base and it receives plenty of support from both first party and third party developers,positive
loved the first two and looking forward to the third a nice alternative to the fps shooters out there,positive
funny seeing them shooting ink at the metal part of one of the salmonid bosses that boss takes no dmg when hit on its metal parts only its tail can receive damage,neutral
just have to say this is the best “primer” i’ve seen for this game fantastic “coverage” tom,positive
i love the idea of just shooting paint in the scenery that alone was enough for me to love the franchise im glad we already have a third game,positive
it looks really good imo thats what i love about nintendo its always colourful and incredibly fun to play sometimes thats all you need colours in your life,positive
i recommend using gyroscope it is the best option to take advantage in this game,positive
i’m looking forward to this one thanks for your analysis though admittedly i don’t get too tripped up by graphics and performance unless it’s abysmal,positive
splatoon is a lot of fun to jump in and play some games 3 will be the first i play from its release excited,positive
definitely excited for this all the specs aside it’s gonna be a lot of fun,positive
i seem to recall splatoon 2 being a dynamic 900p so it’s nice to see they were able to optimize the game enough to finally make it up to 1080p,positive
the oled screen is so incredible compared to the original my flatmate bought one and i can’t look at it without sheer envy,positive
watching an adult get so excited about video games is my favorite thing ever literally can’t stop smiling thank you for that ,positive
the screen is noticeably better so it definitely improves the on the go experience,positive
haven’t watched this channel in a while and it’s honestly refreshing to see this level of excitement on youtube  makes me feel giddy which i haven’t felt in over 10 years,positive
managed to create a better demoreview than even nintendo could hope to do with the commercials incredible,positive
the oled model definitely looks cool id love to try it out one day,positive
the oled screen is truly amazing and the games look way more detailed,positive
i was curious as to when youd be able to do this unboxing we all knew you were getting one but never knew when youd reveal it well worth the wait ,positive
watching this again because my friends got me hooked on video games and after watching animal crossing and pokémon streams i kinda have been researching which switch would be better for my technology availability now i think i definitely should save up for this one i like bigger screen option and newer version can’t wait to see it available on local stores as i just discovered i could possibly even get it on my mobile carrier contract for less than my iphone 12 also i see this as good option when you don’t have smart tv to play games on like my friends and i even looked up possible laptop connections so this one looks right up to my alley also for when i’m willing to give my phone a break or just feel like playing video games which is something i’ve only been discovering few weeks ago,positive
i actually love every single video that you do…i love seeing the joy and legit happiness that you show,positive
two broken nintendo switches in one video that has to be a record whats the weirdest amazon product youve ever found use my code beatemups10 and link to get 10 off save up to 47 your own authentic japanese subscription box from bokksu dont miss out on this amazing snackjourney through japan sponsored by bokksu ,positive
life pro tip you dont need to use your expensive console to test if something is waterproof just use paper or something,neutral
255 i believe the general majority of the case is “waterproof” in sense that rain won’t get in if it lands on it or it gets splashed but the zipper area is definitely not waterproof it will not make it through submersion aside from that i think it simply looked simplistic and rather stylish,neutral
im not gonna lie the part where you just documented your experiences with real people fixing the joycon is so refreshing and i loved this part of the video please take us shopping or something lol i know were like in a pandemic but if theres an opportunity to do it safely please take it,positive
i love how friendly and cheerful was that retro employee haha,positive
i just love how unexpected everything is going better than any netflix series,positive
a soon as he said the word waterproof i was like here we go boys,neutral
the screw up was turning it on without making sure it was 100 dry theres a possibility it wouldve worked fine,neutral
retro madness doesnt have much in terms of games but i will definitely keep an eye on them its easy to get retro games here in japan but obviously theyre in japanese ive noticed how hard it it to find a used game store like this on the states so this is a great find especially since they sell online thank you,positive
finding controllers dead randomly happens to me to those batter packs would actually be pretty nice especially if they’re reminiscent of wii motes,positive
subscribe and i might give you custom switches phones ipads cars or even a house like this video if you enjoyed it i will be bringing on more subscribers to compete in challenges and win free custom items we also helped a lot of people with medical bills because this is a video where we wanted to do a lot of nice stuff for childrens hospitals and people struggling to pay medical bills thank you for all the support love you all,positive
yo i remember when we did that with ipads last year that was such a fun challenge ,positive
i love the end where he pays the mom a lot if money she looked so happy,positive
i love how he gives away money and customized electronics to people in need and i fully support that,positive
this man inspired me to work hard on art and i achieved it,positive
bingewatching here you guys are amaaaaziiing,positive
your videos are amazing my man ,positive
it’s so kind of him he does what he enjoys but he also give them away thank you zach,positive
your just awesome theres just no other way to describe youyour truly amazing keep up the good work,positive
i just realized that in every video when zhc works by himself he wins all the time,positive
just because it was designed in tokyo doesn’t mean it has to drift,neutral
“you know when i was a kid i used to think you were cool” despite not being a nintendo dev myself that line still cut deep,neutral
when i was a kid i used to think you were cool when he was a kid you could bludgeon 12 people to death with each individual peice of first party hardware and itd still work fucking flawlessly consoles handhelds controllers carts that shit was made of nokium it did not break the number of times i threw a controller playstation you could only throw that once they were always the most sensitive xbox until the xbox one you could abuse that shit for five ten years and still see it work when you werent seeing red rings nintendo literally murder people with their gear it did not give a fuck,negative
apparently its because theyre cheaply made the parts in the joysticks are apparently fairly fragile and the buttons are suboptimal shoulder buttons are reported to give out because of poor soldering and lack of reinforcements theres also an issue with wiring as the button and the r button are wired together while the opposite joycon is wired regularly in other words the joycons while the optimal method to play the switch in its entirety are poorly designed for their tasks,negative
iwata and reggie were the souls of nintendo they embodied why every nintendo fan loved nintendo myself included every other gaming platform at the time just felt like they were shoving shit down your throat but when nintendo was showing off stuff it was like they were popping into your living room to show you the stuff they’ve been working on and were so proud of it but when they left all that soul of the company left with them i’ll always be a nintendo fan but that doesn’t mean they’re at the best were i think they can be,positive
remember if nintendo takes this down then its canon,neutral
“you know when i was a kid i used to think you were cool” this applies to so many companies and people who turned out to be terrible i’ve honestly lost count,negative
its not a mistake its a feature nintendo haters how are you supposed to play mario kart without drift,neutral
friendly reminder that the underpayed and overworked customer support nintendo staff is not in fact the one that is in charge of the design of the joy cons nor the culprit of nintendos greedy practice be civil demand your rights but respect the poor human at the other side of the phone,negative
from my experience my drifting issues have largely been caused by dust blowing into the stick with compressed air or using alcohol to clean them appears to do a pretty decent job at fixing the issue still bullshit that we have to deal with this though and not everyone is as lucky as i am and may need to get their stick repaired,negative
i think without e3 it threw off everything for nintendo that’s the place for their biggest presentations and since it didn’t happen this year nintendo just decided to quietly chug along until they were ready to share more as things come,neutral
those splatoon joycons are nice,positive
im finally going to try splatoon since theres a free trial and looking forward to harvestella there are so many games i want coming out in september too im looking forward to ooblets disney dreamlight valley lemoncake wyldeflowers potion permit and hokko life so far,positive
hopefully we get something for botw2 probably more of mxr2 maybe a small bit for sv finally some good news to make the week better,positive
dang i just want a normal direct even tho im excited about this i want a normal direct,positive
another botw2 trailer would be great that or wind waker and twilight princess for switch announcement,positive
i’m really excited for the september direct,positive
hey ive been a really big fan of your channel for a long time now keep up the great work but if possible and not to cause too much of an inconvenience would it be cool if you added cst timezones as well i know i could just convert the times online but i would feel a lot better and more confident about the absolute schedule if you were the one who also inputted a central timezone schedule again im not trying to cause any inconvenience only if youre cool with it thanks i really love your content definitely one of the best nintendo intel providers i can rely on and watch almost daily,positive
i want a new mainline super mario game also they need revive franchises like fzero and starfox,positive
zack finally has some good news ,positive
022 10 pokemon legends arceus 154 9 super mario 3d world bowsers fury 331 8 super smash bros ultimate 448 7 mario kart 8 deluxe 557 6 metroid dread 706 5 kirby and the forgotten land 834 4 xenoblade chronicles definitive edition 1000 3 luigis mansion 3 1118 2 super mario odyssey 1740 1 the legend of zelda breath of the wild 1246 honorable mention 1 splatoon 2 1340 honorable mention 2 xenoblade chronicles 2 1442 honorable mention 3 animal crossing new horizons 1546 honorable mention 4 super mario maker 2 1650 honorable mention 5 pikmin 3 deluxe,neutral
tbh i believe mariorabbids belonged in that list it had a great villain and a great problem creator it also had great battle actions and cutscenes i also love the fact that the villains of the game were mixed together with something to make them who they are,positive
i got my first switch a month ago the oled edition and i gotta say its one of my favorite consoles ever i started with the playstation 1 then the gamecube gameboy advanced sp wii xbox 360 3ds xl then really got into pc games and then stopped playing videogames for many years so it was a delight getting the switch specially because of the great games it has my favorite so far have been fire emblem three houses animal crossing new horizons and smash ultimate also really surprised with mario kart 8 its a lot of casual fun well this is my paragraph that no one asked for lol great video btw,positive
5 years later the switch library is amazing and i have most of these games what a nice list of games great video editing as well luigis mansions animationsgraphics are top tier pikmin 3 deluxe is amazing on that as well and hope more people pick it up waiting on pikmin 4 you have a new subscriber,positive
xenoblade 3 needs the first spot imo such a beautiful and amazing game that actually manage to perfect a system that was already in place,positive
definitely dragon dogma for the best most complex combat system and great character development so many factors come into play npc companions learn player behavior improve can be borrowed from other players and then come back with gifts and trophies and new knowledge class change at any time a game that went down with the release of skyrim but remains one of the best fantasy rpgs to this day the sequel arisen finally brought a few more fast travel crystals into play,positive
im not a big mario fan but paper mario on switch is really really good picnic road and so many other soundtracks are sooooo good amazing game play too clean 810,positive
thank you for explaining that turf war is the casual mode in splatoon it seems silly but so many people judge the entire game on that mode alone,neutral
as a oled switch owner i have to say that it’s a great list but i’d include switch sports and mario party superstars in the honorable mentions those are the type of games that makes the nintendo switch be different than any other consoles in the market the local multiplayer of this little thing called nintendo switch is nasty,negative
as a person who lived through the dark ages of the wii u im so glad nintendo is back making so cool games for us since the switch released,positive
this looks a lot better than the version they showed last year smooth framerate fastpaced action and over the top silliness welcome back bayonetta ,positive
i’m hoping jeanne plays more of a role in this game it’s going to be the first time that she’ll be active throughout the story without being mind controlled she really only appeared in the prologue and epilogue last time,positive
bayonetta deserves even more shine she may not be trending but this third installment will not disappoint,positive
the fact that sigurd mentions a way to an “alphaverse” with alpha usually meaning first kinda reinforces the idea that we’re in the universe where cereza wasn’t sealed away and the climax of the story could probably involve our main bayonetta because it’s confirmed we’re gonna meet other bayonettas this also kinda ties into how hellena taylor tweeted about getting used to not hearing her iconic voice which could mean the kinda low and seductive one she uses for our main bayo,neutral
guys if we can see how cool bayonetta looks with her new summons and moves imagine jeanne i can’t wait to see the difference hoping that jeanne is playable and maybe even with her actual voice actor also i’m really loving the new bg music in the first scene it’s such a bayonetta genre of music,positive
the music the story the characters the boss fights in the future… i’m getting hyped for this game owo,positive
looks so good that game clearly looks like platinum was given all the time in the world to make the game as best as they can on the switch can’t praise nintendo enough for keeping this franchise alive,positive
nothing beats the hype of a good stylish action game and this looks like a damn good follow up to two of the best,positive
bayonetta is gorgeous and her style with lady butterfly and her armor is too dopehope that the combat gets some more content besides the trailerim thinking that some nuances and combat systems will show up ingame wellgotta rack up some cash to get this one day one 3,positive
at first i wasn´t convinced with the aesthetics of this game but the more i see this trailer the smoother it actually looks and the graphics does not seem bad at all,positive
i think im the best singer on youtube cant lie,positive
downloading the dlc from nso feels a little confusing so maybe they just got too many complaints or questions about it plus dlc on nso is a key part of the benefits so they just want to have it covered my take,negative
idk man i think it’s smart to tell some parents who are not gamers how to download dlc because it allows them to give more exposure to their subscription which i argue is a great value to those interested in the content it provides,positive
i was recently thinking about what would be next for nsoep and i thought it would be a great idea if gameboy and gameboy colour get launched on the standard tier in september whilst adding gameboy advance and nintendo gamecube to the expansion pack tier in october one year after the expansion pack tier had launched i also think that your idea of super mario odyssey dlc being added would be brilliant,positive
it was about downloading the dlc included with the nso expansion which is done differently than other dlc and im pretty sure it came out to coincide with the new pack of tracks with mk8 deluxe,neutral
the problem is its not telegraphed well to the general user that they have access to the mario kart tracks for example they need to upgrade their ux and put it in the switch online section of the os and also message it better my guess when i saw this was that they can see loads of people arent taking advantage of downloading dlc as part of their sub,negative
about the download dlc video i think it’s more to explain how to download the dlc for free when you’re a nso member because i believe many people would think that you’d buy dlc in the eshop but there’s an option on the dlc page to download for free so the video is warranted… although it should’ve been published last year when nso launched ,neutral
after going through and seeing the user interface the download button is not as prominent as the proceed to purchase button is obvious i can see people hitting the purchase button thinking that will get them to where they need to go but then they see that they have to pay for it and get frustrated i have some experience with uxui design so that stands out,negative
wave race being here is pretty damn hype hoping we get dk64 and uh maybe goldeneye soon,positive
virtual boy games for nintendo labo would be nice as well as optional colour pallete swaps so you can either play in authentic red scale or have it recoloured to include all colours of the rainbow,positive
a mí me gusta que sea de pago ya que eso genera que no haya microtransacciones pero lo que me molesta es pagar para jugar online después de comprar el juego,neutral
splatoon 3 es una experiencia que ningún otro shoter puede ofrecerte aunque todo lo de nintendo evidentemente cuesta dinero ,positive
creo que uno de los fallos al ser gratuito como fortnite o fall guys es que debe ser multiconsola y permití interacción online entre ellas cosa que splatton solo es de nintendo en lo personal me molesta el modo micropagos para cuestiones cosméticas pero más cuando las mejoras de equipo si cuestan porque lo vuelve un ptw creo que es mejor pagar por un juego completo que sea gratis y las recompensas sean una baba que no sirve de nada,neutral
nunca he jugado splatoon probaré la versión de prueba en unos días y veré si me lo compro o no tiene buena pinta,neutral
yo opinó que el juego es perfecto así lo único que sería genial es jugarlo sin online ya que muchísimas personas no tienen para el servicio,neutral
a mi me hubiese gustado mucho que le hubiese añadido un modo cpu al igual que lo tiene los mario karts o super smash bros como opción para los que no pueden permitirse pagar el online y caso cerrado ,neutral
este será mi primer splatoon si lo compro de otra región para ahorrar dinero aún podré usar el online de méxico de forma correcta o tendré problemas ,neutral
no sé qué tan desacuerdo estaría conque sea gratis personalmente prefiero pasar por caja una sola vez y tener prácticamente todo lo disponible,neutral
si el juego se enfoca en multijugador si debería de ser gratis esto mismo paso con halo infinite que el multijugador es gratis para todos hasta en pc además al ser gratis impulsaría la compra de membresías online de nintendo b,neutral
no creo que deba ser gratuito por qué si es así le pasaría lo mismo que al tf2,neutral
dejad un rt para apoyarnos no te pierdas la futrue game show,neutral
yo estaba viendo cada vez más factible que el nintendo direct fuese el día 1 me monté la película de que nintendo quería hacer eventos o dar noticias cada semana desde el partner showcase hasta el direct de septiembre y tenía la sensación de que el treehouse era como su útimo recurso para cumplir dicho objetivo aunque a saber incluso siendo la semana del 12 puede que sea cierto y estas semanas las completen con treehouses de otros juegos como mario rabbids o sonic frontiers por cierto se agradece mucho que también deis noticias pequeñas como la del canal de sakurai,neutral
también el día 15 en la tokyo game show capcom que ya ha confirmado su participación tanto presencial como online retransmitirá ese mismo día a las 1600h cest un programa online centrándose en títulos de la propia capcomcomo monster hunterhablarán de la 2° actualización gratuita de mh sunbreak fechada para finales de septiembre y megaman y luego el día 16 a las 1700h cest retransmitirá un programa especial dedicado a street fighter 6,neutral
tengo entendido que lo que ya no se podra es añadir fondos de ninguna manera pero si se podra seguir comprando si tienes unificados los saldos de 3ds y switch se podra comprar por sea caso,neutral
tengo miedo de que tampoco haya direct en septiembre,neutral
ojalá salga un starfox muchas ganas de que hagan un juego potente franquicia bastante desperdiciada,neutral
siiiii si el direct es el 14 será en mi cumple tremendo regalo jajaja ojalá espero que haya algo de starfox ,neutral
nintendo ha anunciado la fecha en la que cerrarán las tiendas digitales de wii u y nintendo 3ds será el próximo 27 de marzo de 2023 y ya no se podrá comprar nada aunque si tienes el juego podrás seguir descargándolo recibiendo actualizaciones de software y jugando online,neutral
no van a cerrar las eshops hasta marzo solo no se podrá meter dinero pero si tienes vinculada la eshop de switch no hay problema,neutral
lo de pokémon si somos optimistas puede ser bueno si se tardan 1 año en hacer un juego y lo acaban antes podrían tener más tiempo para pulirlo  con fe,neutral
12709 ehh this line was pretty dumb the game engine unity has nothing to do with how the game feels when controlling my apologies for this one,negative
be warned guys this is scotts last ever nintendo switch five years in video so savour it,neutral
this isnt the nintendo i grew up loving yeah because you werent paying attention back then easily your most cutting line to date,negative
i really respect how scott is a big nintendo fan but isnt fooled and pledging blind allegiance to them for nostalgias sake so many of the decisions they make can be so blatantly anti consumer and it blows my mind how some fans will hop in the line of fire to block any shots sent nintendos way being extra dramatic and hardheaded no matter how egregious their actions may be,negative
this video has the scott the woz feel all over it it is definitely a video is it sure has been five years in 1010,positive
it’s been over a year and i still see mario 3d all stars on store shelves,neutral
the fact that balan wonderworld and breath of the wild came out 4 years apart and both cost 60 makes me unbelievably sad,negative
i’m going to be legit sad when the switch era ends this is the last nintendo console that came out before i graduated i’m having less and less time to play games but the few hours i put at them bring me tons of joy i hope i can have time for the switch 2,positive
i’m seriously impressed how scott can talk for over 2 hours and still keep it interesting even if i can’t watch it in 1 go i still come back to watch the whole thing,positive
this was a joy to watch i really like this series just wrapping up a whole year in sections is a great way to look back this year felt pretty monotone for me i wasnt over hyped for anything and as a pokemon fan pla was cool but bdsp felt janky kirby was incredible kingdom hearts being cloud versions was the biggest let down for me though,positive
cant wait cool to see some prolonged gameplay,positive
319 something i noticed that is so small but such a good detail is instead of abruptly stopping they gradually skid to a stop amazing detail,positive
is it just me or does it look like everyone will be able to dodge roll now and not just duelie mains i think splatoon three is gonna be easy to pick up but hard to master nothing wrong with that though cant wait to meet everybody in the turf war,positive
048 new inkzoka looks cool looks very strong and the 3 shot limit really helps balance it out a bit my question however is if the rainmaker will take on this kind of “triple spiral shot” that the inkzoka has as the rainmaker always takes after the cannon like special in each game would make for interesting ranked matches,positive
the specials are looking more aggressive than splatoon 2s while not being totally op like splatoon 1s were eeltail alleys looking quite welldesigned for something so basic and open the stringers looking like it could be more flexible than the old chargers but it might not have charge storage when morphed and im calling it the vacuum specials going to be called the sucker shot well that was a disappointment and after theyd done so well with other names like killer wail echolocator bubbler inkjet etc,neutral
i really love the added player titles and medals awarded to the players at the end of each match not to mention the music is hard just 4 and a half months and the wait will finally be over,positive
what i have gleamed from this is that ill definitely be playing turf war a lot more in this installment the specials look like they actually benefit turf war compared to the previous versions and will definitely be a lot more fun overall in ranked modes i love the aggressive approach to the specials too reverting back to what splatoon offered it gives people a chance who normally wouldnt be able to dominant due to lack of necessary skill or just going against weapons that absolutely oppress them i personally play short ranged weapons and it gets tough to approach when you are constantly matched up with mid to longranged weapons when your weapon doesnt have the kit to contend definitely a plus seeing brush being able to grapple because in certain do or die situations the brush may be the last line of defense and deserves a chance to shine without constantly having to wait until opponents approach you,positive
i can’t even this game is going to be so good the added player titles the new music absolutely slaps and the new victory animations and just everything else,positive
this gameplay is awesome and i am loving the music being played especially now or never it sounds more intense than the other splatoon games really gives off the feeling that it is the last minute of the match and the team that is losing must make a comeback fast,positive
i love the new display and gear the new abilities fit the “city of chaos” get up i like how it shows what weapons we should expect to have their specials can’t wait to see if they release a test fire,positive
pin,neutral
the fact this came from kotaku means it cant be taken serious,negative
soo let me get this straight a person that refuses to reveal their identity 1 point tells a very fishy story 1 point without any proof 1 point for a joke that wasnt even sexual harassment 1 point then she revealed her tragic story to kotaku 1 point yeah no lmao i cant even take this seriously,negative
calling kotaku a reliable source is like calling twitter users intelligent,neutral
if one guy posting memes in a group chat is the best example they can find of these years of sexual harassment at noa i think its safe to say they dont have a harassment problem,neutral
you don’t get to say stray is a racist game and have me take you seriously one of innumerable examples if people really are doing criminalinappropriate things at work then punish them accordingly but until someone with a shred of integrity reports it i will withhold judgement,negative
if she thinks a couple of inappropriate jokes over the course of 9 years is a harrowing experience she must live a very sheltered life,negative
someone making sexual jokes about fictional characters in a chat is not sexual harassment its not even directed at her she wants it to be harassment specifically because shes a woman who was part of the chat,negative
oh kotaku a very very “reliablecredible” source of information with no activist agenda nor creating drama to mine click or dehumanizing gamers doesn’t kotaku have an axe to grind with nintendo,negative
taking kotaku seriously is like taking what people say on twitter seriously,neutral
¿qué fecha estimas para el nintendo direct de septiembre y que sorpresas crees que traerá ¡próximos directos en el canal · future games show · nintendo treehouse ¡sorteo de zenith para nintendo switch ​haz rt para apoyar el contenido hazte miembro para apoyar el canal,neutral
donde anuncien un nuevo mario en 3d para switch exploto de la emoción y también eso diría mucho de nintendo sobre las intenciones que tienen con switch por que un mario 3d usualmente sale a vender nueva consola por lo que si lanzan un nuevo juego así me haría pensar a mi que no están pensando en lanzar una nueva consola en el futuro cercano muy curioso pero no importa por mi esta bien por que adoro el nintendo switch sobre todo con los juegazos que están sacando últimamente,neutral
yo me conformo con que salga algo de zelda en este año incluso si termina siendo un port de twilight princess o wind waker hd,neutral
a ver si salga un pequeño trailer de la película de súper mario bros por qué si sale una muestra del videojuego de súper mario bros 3d falta el tráiler de la película animada,neutral
yo automaticamente ya me salto el avance inicial 2min hasta después de la intro y ya tranquilamente escucho todo qué ganas de direct   ,positive
tiene sí o sí prenestar algo sony  y si es así será épico,positive
con que me enseñen algo del nuevo zelda me conformo septiembre viene cargadito saludos desde cuba,neutral
sabes que juego si espero un buen remaster y lo merece el brutal the last history que habia en wii nintendo tiene joyas llevando polvo,neutral
vaya ya no puedo esperar de este nintendo direct y me intriga mas el nuevo juego de mario,neutral
mario zelda y metroid  mi santísima trinidad nintendera vendrán con todo a romperla,positive
im not sold on the new gimmick and frankly nothing will ever beat the sheer excitement mega evolution gave me but im really looking forward to play both of these games,positive
one day one day id love to watch one of these pokemon presents and have a new shadow pokemon game be revealed,positive
im really hoping we get to battle other regions champions in the end game and who else prefers mega evolution,positive
“the abundant nature” screen shows player traversing blank terrain with one or two pokémon species and approaching a gas station to refuel their lizardcycle,neutral
we finally getting crystal onix,positive
its finally heading the right way arceus was just a tester for this bigger game but they definitely need new hardware and get the graphics and framerate better for on tvs,positive
912 for scarlet and violet coverage,neutral
i’m sooooo excited for “the abundant nature”,positive
one day one day id love to watch one of these pokemon presents and have a new shadow pokemon game be revealed,positive
when do the two legendaries fuse together to become the almighty megazord,neutral
time for real talk with rgt lol,neutral
perfectly said i’ve been bringing up stuff like this for years and i absolutely despise this double standard you can love their games all you want i certainly do but nintendo as a company is seriously one of the worst in the industry stop discounting everything they do just because you have good memories of them this needs to be fixed not just at nintendo but everywhere,negative
good stuff man people being inconsistent is the only consistent part of the internet,positive
when i was a kid in the early 90s you could still write a sloppy hand written 4 page letter with crayon drawings and send it to nintendo of america and they would immediately write you back answering every single question you had no matter how dumb it was and complementing your crappy drawings in detail i think my dad might still have some of their response letters in his desk those days are long gone,negative
you’re 100 right everyone has to decide for themselves how serious this stuff is but at the end of the day there’s a lot of virtue signalling going on also while we’re at it let’s all admit that as much as people like to hate kotaku at least they’re willing to report this kind of stuff,negative
here’s a hot take most hardcore gamerstech workers who would in “nerd” stuff are going to be a bunch of socially awkward weirdos this is why these things happen at all gaming companies and places like gencon where they virtue signal but these virtue signalers are the ones who commit assault andor harassment ,negative
no new concept was added to my life with this video maybe it will help someone out there to see companies as companies not friends,neutral
its good to see that youre always willing to speak your mind in a time where anybody that speaks up on anything will be bashed and harassed for being honest the direction things are going in general on speaking out is sad appreciate you and your brutal honesty brother ,positive
i like nintendo games but not people who commit sexual harassment which happens in too many places men and women do act in unsolicited ways towards others,negative
congratulations rgt you’re finally learning what trends are it seems nintendo hasn’t trended negatively like activision has so their opinions haven’t been altered,positive
i miss the days when you unlocked these things by playing the game at your own pace characters and stages were always cool rewards for beating the game’s challenges,positive
congratulations nintendo you did it you added what should have been there in the first place,positive
thank god the queen of mario sportsparty games is finally here daisy deserves better i absolutely love her ,positive
daisy should have been there from the first but i am glad to see more than a single character in these updates 2 a stage and gear its exciting but it also means my expectations were very low,positive
i do really appreciate how new characters still get hand drawn art to match everyone else if all the dlc adds new stages gear and characters then i’ll be coming back to this game for a long time,positive
it’s about time daisy came to this game she should’ve been here from the drop i am so hyped,positive
this is a bare minimum update that should have been there day one i want to see much bigger updates in the future,positive
id never argue with new content entirely so im grateful and happy theyve added what they added here i think if the game wants to see a potential sector for longevity it would need to have a spectator mode and possibly proper 4v4 online where all players can be remote so that there could be a tourney scene i myself would be hosting them regularly with a spectator mode client but it could go esports if they had a tournament scene like that but like i say im happy for any additional content being added to the game and i hope theyll consider modesfeatures for the updates to come,positive
you guys really need to start releasing your games with full content on release,positive
good to see them adding in more stadiums too not just characters,positive
i dont know why but its so nice seing people get nice things for themselves ,positive
i think that this is the most beautiful unboxing for this nintendo that i’ve ever seen ,positive
very nice,positive
hey just to let u know at 755 u go to press the power button on the switch to turn it on but u can actually hold the home button on ur joy con to turn ur switch on as well 3 a lot easier especially if ur playing docked hope this helps,positive
ngl im not into this whole aesthetics vibe but ur videos have helped me find the right accessories for my switch and have made my days more peaceful thanks peachdudu,positive
oooh the case is so cute i like the peach one too hahah nice to see you uploading again since youre way more active on instagram,positive
the peach joycon looks so cute,positive
all the accessories look so cute,positive
great video love how you style everything so cutely  i really wish to get my own switch oled soon btw where did you buy this tiny white tv looking thing in the back with the pastel buttons,positive
omg that’s so cool congrats on the new switch this was so relaxing to watch,positive
get the products here nintendo switch earbuds  nintendo switch dust cover  nintendo switch thumb grips ,neutral
this is the same guy that said a screen protector is useless,negative
now he’s actually mentioning unessesary accessories,neutral
its was like i was in space so they dont work because there is no sound in space,negative
i love how he says that a steering wheel for race games are unnecessary but then says that you need a sticker on the thumbstick,neutral
reminder this was the same guy that said that a charging portable stand is useless because the switch has a kickstand,negative
a fan for your switch is useless haha heres a dust cover,negative
the only thing the dust cover will do is cause your switch to overheat because the airintakeexhaust of the cooler gets covered,neutral
felt like i was in space in space there is no noise,positive
use other headphones they work just fine,positive
what do you think of all of this will it be in future games lemme know,neutral
id like to see a 4k docked and 1080p handheld successor to the switch thats backwards compatible and more powerful with better graphics online and frame rate too,positive
what i need going forward is a nintendo switch successor that is backwards compatible and offers improvements to previously released games i need to play xenoblade chronicles 2 and torna over again in true 1080p or at 1440p whether it be 30fps or 60fps i just want them to be clear with further and more saturated draw distances and that dynamic resolution removed of course this would benefit many other games but i havent ng xc2 because i am hopeful ill get to reexperience improved on new hardware,positive
i actually feel nintendo should probably leave their next gen design choice at the nintendo switch level its the perfect system whether you want a home console portable or both they should just focus on upgrading hardware on each gen or giving it refreshes with better design implementations like joycons with pro controller sticks id also like to see more things the switch could be paired with like linking to discord and spotify and having them run in the background,positive
graphics do matter but its more tied to the visual style and aesthetics that are implemented i dont care about super realistic graphics i just want stable eyepleasing visuals with amazing gameplay look no further than how poorly some of the earlier realistic graphics have aged on previous consoles while games with a more unique art style have remained timeless,neutral
given nintendos track record with moves that make sense they will use this feature sparingly as they did with cloud gaming and file transfers,neutral
it must be difficult for nintendo to decide on how to move on from the switch i would like to see the next console hybrid hopefully support switch cartridges still,neutral
i wonder if no mans sky coming to switch in october will incorporate some of this new tech weve been seeing more of seems like a game like that will need all the help it can get to run smoothly on the switch im still really curious to see how it turns out likely will either be a pretty solid 30fps or 30fps with frame drops and low res i suspect the low rest automatically in either case but i never played the game so im interested to possibly give it a try if its a half decent port,positive
i still love my switch but after owning the steam deck for a couple of weeks i have to say valve is doing a substantially better job supporting the steam deck then nintendo is the switch ive already got more updates that have made the system even better in a couple weeks then nintendo has in 5 years nintendo needs to take a page out of valves playbook here,positive
i’d love to see monolith apply this tech either fsr 10 or dlss when the newer model drops in an update to xenoblade chronicles 2 all the xenoblade games are in my evergrowing backlog so i think i’ll wait to see if this actually happens ,positive
so should we do another one of these videos next time  go to for 15 off your order brought to you by raycon,positive
this feels like a special sitcom episode when the whole cast is in another country xd love it,positive
og beatemups style content with a new crowd this is great stuff wood always fun to go along on the hunt with you all,positive
bob’s commentary made this video feel like a mockumentary  also seeing vlog style nintendo content recorded in nyc took me back to the cnd etika days man  such good times,positive
there’s a part of me that was getting the vibe of old cnd vlogs at the beginning there just seeing the store again brought me back to good times,positive
i love this new documentary style its so nice seeing everyone have fun together,positive
god i want to go to the nintendo store in new york so badly it seems like it has so much cool stuff in it,positive
bobs commentary makes everything better,positive
omg just loved hanging out with you guys in this video it really reminded me of the time some friends and i used to go game hunting in são paulo like about 20 years ago thanks for bringing those sweet memories back i would definitely love more videos like this one ,positive
awe the japan videos are the exact time i found you while researching if i wanted to buy my wife a switch for christmas ,positive
is the steam deck the end of nintendo switch what are your thoughts are you buying one why or why not  go to for up to 15 off your order brought to you by raycon,neutral
ive had my steam deck for about a month now and your reaction to the weight was exactly the same reaction i had everyone says its so big but honestly when you hold it in your hand and feel that weight it makes everything go away amazing handheld,positive
personally i’d much rather a free carrying case then fancy unnecessary packaging i appreciate a company that’s forgo paying the extra bucks on packaging and placing it into something more functional to the consumer in the long run,positive
while i really have no plans to get a steam deck im hoping that a little healthy competition for the switch will make nintendo step up their game with the next switch or with some sort of pro model like the fans have been crying for for years,neutral
the steam deck is an excellent friendly competitor nintendos advantage is many great first ip and tons of third parties not to mention name recognition but the stream deck could make nintendo focus on creating a nintendo switch pro or nintendo switch 2 that has more power which i think is great because it puts more pressure on nintendo to do better,positive
i think fancy premium packaging would be cool but i like the fact that they are trying to be less wasteful in comparison to other businesses,positive
the packaging feels really nice and valvelike they made it simple and homey if you get me and it feels like a homemade dinner in comparison to the switches package which would be compared to a fancy restaurant the outside doesn’t matter it’s the inside that matters this couldn’t be more true with the steam deck,positive
while the steam decks performance handling these aaa games is impressive id really like to see more content creators focus on other aspects the steam deck is a fantastic way for first timers to try pc gaming and it really has so much more to offer where i feel it really shines is the extensive catalog of lesser known smaller and past titles basically pick any random old game and it will likely allow settings comparable to the rereleaseremaster releases that you have to wait for and pay extra on console older games often look much better on smaller screens too so many should be fantastic on that little thing,positive
one of my favorite uses for my steam deck was loading emudeck and having the virtual console ive always wished the switch would be,positive
this is the best steam deck ive watched even out of all the tech youtubers and video game channels love the up in the video production quality as well wood keep levelling up awesome content,positive
did you like what xbox had to show at gamescome,neutral
xbox is just going strong and its becoming the most preferred platform pretty quickly,positive
i’m actually hyped for lies of p and it’s day one on game pass man next years is going to be a crazy year for games,positive
when they showed the lies of p trailer and it was coming to game pass and then it was given most anticipated playstation game i laughed so hard,positive
lies of p in gamepass  callisto protocol looks amazing i’m really looking forward to what gamepass is bringing for the rest of the year edit atomic heart is still set to release at the end of the year another great looking gamepass game day one,positive
ps fanboys game pass is full of fodder that no one wants to play also ps fanboys cant wait for life of p,negative

i doubt well get any new announcements anytime soon and i dont really care about indie games theyre all kind of the same to me they just look different most of the time and about pc feel like they should work more on xbox and not pc and i have pc but thats me,negative
i just can’t wait to play fable that’s really the only game i’m looking forward to,positive
high on life is going to be my go to game the gameplay they showed i believe is the first boss battle my bet the further you get into the game the bigger the boss the bigger environment youll be fighting them in,positive
let me know what you think and please consider subscribing here become a member here,neutral
he specified one box exclusives in the market those exclusives are necessary in order to get subscribers if all the services are the same there wont be no point in services its like with netflix and diseny exclusive content but that is allowed to come out on blue ray from disney but not on netflix same thing for services,neutral
i love how some people are missing the point of his statement he literally means “one platform” xbox been doing this for years and now even playstation is slowing doing it,neutral
youre constantly putting out extremely well curated and delivered content thank you ,positive
i think phil is referring to games coming to pc and mobile as for xbox games it means the same but also where ever game pass is too i seen a lot of playstation fanboys acting like xbox will go 3rd party and all xbox games will be on playstation,neutral
console exclusives arent going anywhere they would be insane to split market share off of their hardware their ecosystem and ultimately their control nintendo has dominated both sony and microsoft this generation with the unreal success of the switch they are the proof in the pudding that hardware and exclusives are still what drive the consumer towards the platform,positive
destin i think i enjoy your content because it pushes rational debates or argument to the issue of exclusives i think the strategy of ms has already been spelled out what i think ms plans to do is make the console the foundation of their business strategy they will have console exclusives but they will not restrict their games to just the console device which is sonys strategy it just means they will release on multiple devices from pcs to tvs to mobile phones and through cloud ms has expanded agreesively but i personally do not think their games will go to sony consoles like most people tend to think because sony are their competition,positive
i think its a time of wait and see imo were seeing all these investments because interest rates are low if at the end of the process sony for example dont see financial gain i can easily see it reverting were all hoping this works as gamers but none of us know what the end result will be,neutral
phil spencer said the day of the press conference welcoming bethesda into the fold that it was about making games available on platforms where game pass exist so this is not anything new hes staying consistent,positive
i would love to boot up my console and swap from battlefield to halo to spiderman to mario kart to pokémon within the same ecosystem but i just dont think something like that will happen unless there is a third party neutral console that has all the subscriptions for each major player on it,neutral

im so hyped for starfield but i feel like i cant be 100 sold on it because of how this was basically what happened with fallout 76 major hype then it releases and colossal flop i really hope bethesda can deliver this time ,neutral
probably the biggest w ever such amazing games and very well done to xbox for doing this for us xbox better forever ,positive
super happy about the pretty substantial single player games coming out not into online social multiplayer games at all so this was very much welcomed,positive
wow i watched summerfest and was like wtf this could of been sent out in an email this show blew it out of the water so many gampass games to actually look forward to hopefully these games actually deliver in the hype,positive
this game was very beautiful in 4k in 4k we can see very details of the game i hope bethesda continues the good work until the launch of it,positive

great presentation love the actual gameplay footage and variety of games very grateful for game pass love this service,positive
what do you think about the future of console exclusives thanks for watching and liking the video 3,positive
what would be the point in multiple consoles if they are all the same then we might as well have a one console nation no competition or reasons to buy different consoles exclusives give each console an identity and reasons to invest into a particular console there’s a reason netflix has different movies from hbo max,neutral
i believe most exclusives will be timed exclusives companies like nintendo will never ever have their first party titles on other platforms,neutral
xbox says “game pass is the future… because we have it”…then “exclusives are doomed… because we have less than none”,negative
i disagree console exclusives is what separates the companies and hardware apart if exclusive games are a thing of the past then their is no need for a playstation xbox or switch everyone will become a pc gamer in a perfect world sony microsoft nintendo will join forces and sony will engineer the hardware with microsoft’s wallet and ambition for higher specs and nintendo’s passion for innovation unfortunately we don’t live in such a world,neutral
if all games were on one console that would eliminate competition and create a monopoly,neutral
considering how well nintendo exclusives sell on all their hardware and especially so on the switch i find phils comments laughable,negative
i have had a love hate relationship with console exclusives i get why they exist and why they draw consumers to a specific platform this coming phil along xboxs track record concerning their exclusives since around 2013 and up havent exactly been praised as playstations have been this is more corporate weasel words xbox has cannibalized and quite frankly wore out their once golden franchises halo gears of war umim sure im forgetting some others the line is going to get blurry with where titles between the respective console manufactures games end up for consumption xbox has doing really well with game pass but they are missing that killer app for the system,negative
ok 1 phil is right as far a exclusives go because they are also on pc so there will be no exclusives 2 multiple devices references pc tv phone console so no they dont need sonys console for sales,neutral
meanwhile nintendo hell nah not me or my son,neutral
pinned comment this video took a little while to put together sorry for the delay but let me know what your favorite reveal was at gamescom 2022,neutral
apart from lies of p and calisto protocol i really found atlas fallen to be really interesting surprised no one is talking about this new game reveal also absolutely thrilled to learn that lies of p will release day 1 on game pass one of the few benefits of owning both consoles that you get to enjoy the best of both worlds,positive
lies of p looks incredible also dead island looks like it could be good high on life looks very fun it was a good showcase lots of game but also lots of ads,positive
this was a very solid gamescom especially loved the bit of trolling we got from kojima seems like this event just keeps getting better every year,positive
favorite reveal was gameplay of lies of p coming to gamepass day 1 yes looks and feels like its gonna be awesome definitely playing it but yea 2023 is stacked,positive
i knew something was missing out of my daily life thanks for the vids jay your work and content is so underrated,positive
atlas fallen the lords of the fallen and lies of p were my favorite take aways from the show well where winds meet too but im hesitant since i dont know if it will release on xbox or not,neutral
high on life is conker but as a first person shooter im hyped for that game lies of p is the successor of bloodborne callisto protocol looking good sonic frontiers im impressed atlas fallen and dead island 2 oh yea ,positive
pretty good show overall can’t wait for lies of p man ,positive
i agree that the show was average but the dead island 2 reveal made my day dead island and dead island riptide are the most addictive zombie games i have played i played both of them all the way to the end,positive
thanks for watching what consoles do you currently own,positive
just bought the series s it looks great loads fast and plays next gen games ill upgrade in a couple years when the series x is easier to find its worth it people,positive
series s is perfect for playstation players who want to expand their gaming library after getting my ps5 i wanted a cheap way into the xbox ecosystem and this has been an amazing console that i honestly grew to appreciate more than the ps5 due to the small size and price,positive
the deal breaker for me is not having a disc drive when ive amassed a huge collection of physical discs thats why i got the series x however for anyone new to xbox or someone who doesnt own physical discs this is a great purchase,positive
ive owned both and the series s has a special place in my heart i love the x but unless youre rocking a tv that supports 4k120 w vrr the series s is just fine also its so tiny and its amazing what a quiet beast it is but definitely buy the storage expansion card regardless of which one you buy,positive
the series s is plain amazing especially with gamepass and if you are into backward compatibility gaming ive just completed the entire gears series on 360 because i never got to play them back in the day gears 1 to judgment and its been a pure blast you can also find an online list of all the games who received an fps boost including xbox and xbox 360 games so theres that too some are now locked at 60 and some are even at 120 fps yes my last name is spencer how did you know,positive
the only next gen console i could find was this one have owned it for about a year 0 regrets would buy it again its amazing its form factor blows my mind so tiny but so powerful,positive
i definitely have no complaints with the series s from what ive seen 1440 is still more than adequate for graphics and it runs super smooth and is still a very quick console,positive
i was totally blown away by my series s i still can’t believe what you can get there for 300 bucks still i upgraded to series x because i’m used to pc quality and the extra fps and native resolution is totally worth investing the extra money still i would totally go for the series s it’s super quiet performance is mind blowing and it’s pretty small i guess this time xbox is superior to playstation even though everybody is freaking out about ps5 and is probably sleeping on the new xbox consoles though they’re way better x is more powerful and the s is a absolute price performance killer i didn’t expect to be that happy with xbox after being used to a high end pc,positive
needless to say that the series s is actually easy to find and purchase while getting a series x for not more than original retail price is difficult,positive
xbox just announced the xbox series s as a suprise so unfortunately its missing in this video the price is also announced 499 for the xbox series x and 299 for the xbox series s what do you think will you buy the series x or s,neutral
i love your content animation is smooth audio isn’t weird and bad and the information is so interesting to watch,positive

seeing the halo game clips brought tears to my eye i remember first playing it on the original xbox and wow best way to introduce me into a game franchise i love being born in the 2000s,positive
when the first xbox came out it had some awesome games on it a decent amount of games as it evolved games started fading for the system it gained way more power etc each time but lacked games with each update lol now we have the ultimate series x microsoft figured since there’s no games for the system for real they gave it the ability to play pc games as well,positive
in a few years when you have millions of subs ill be glad to call myself an og,positive
really well made video packed with useful information and great editing keep it up,positive
when this man hits millions i’ll be happy that i was a part with him through out his journey,positive
ive been xbox ever since the first one and i own all 4 generations of the consoles and in my opinion the 360 was the best one for user interaction as it was simple enough yet an excellent experience,positive

which nextgen console do you prefer,neutral
im more of an xbox person but i still respect playstation,positive
if i didnt have a pc i would have gone for the xbox series x,neutral
for my personal budget i grabbed an xbox series x primarily because of game pass which has been an amazing experience hopefully after tax season i’ll be able to find a ps5 the sony exclusives are the one thing that i’m missing on my xbox but having both of them along with the switch would be a harmony of mathematical precision lol i think all consoles are wonderful in their perspective but together it’s gamers paradise,positive
i’m a fan of gaming not a fan of a specific company i enjoy both systems,positive
my 1st console was the original ps loved it so much that i stayed with them and upgraded to ps2 somewhere in there i picked up a used xbox because my 1st lan party with halo just blew me away then 3rd gen consoles came and both the price of games and consoles went above what i was willing to spend at that time so i turned to nintendo and was happy to play their handheld systems getting the xbox series x was an easy decision for me i have nintendo switch for my exclusives strategy and rpg needs while the xbox satisfied my craving for fps and games that required higher processing and graphical power,positive
honestly for most people it comes to whatever your friends have,neutral
i like them both like they both have great exclusives and great hardware and stunning traffics where it is hard to tell the difference between reality and non reality they both are amazing systems,positive
you quickly mentioned that online depends on where our friends also play that is a win for the xbox because it has direct integration with pc you can chat with anyone on pc but also directly play with them in a slew of gamepass games that silently support crossplay between pc and xbox playstation is doubling down on the walledgarden approach to keep people buying their brand through sunken cost and social ostricization perpetuating the console wars really no brainer microsoft is the one doing far better on supporting multiple platforms and opening the experinece to a larger audience including online,positive
you are absolutely brilliant at reviewing stuff clear and concise,positive
this looks really fresh definitely gonna check this out in release,positive
this looks absolutely ridiculous im all for it,negative
theme art combat everything looks so well crafted wish the story too holds up to make it an awesome game,positive
this game looks very promising theres not many dark souls clones that actually succeed but this has potential,positive
looks insane big win for gamepass,positive
this seems too good to be true beautiful and very unique aesthetics with souls combat mechanics fingers crossed for this one,positive
another elseworld style videogame im excited to see what they will do,positive
so far the coolest thing i think ive seen in gamescom this year ,positive
that end seems like they know exactly what’s going on with the fromsoft crowd that’s art,neutral
absolutely cannot wait to play this day one on game pass man this looks amazing,positive
i was once in line at a gamestop to buy a used ps3 when a guy got in line behind me to trade in his ps3 so i bought the ps3 off the guy for less then what gamestop was selling them and more then what he would have received from the store we both won on that day,positive
as someone i used to work for gamestop my advice is to always buy the used system over the refurbished ones the refurbished ones were broken at one point and whoever fixes them doesnt do a great job,negative
i was a manager at electronics boutique 20 years ago and we had the same problem with the ps2 “company refurbs” and they usually didn’t operate i told my staff to unpack them when they came in immediately mark them as defective and ship them back out we had gotten burned too many times and i wasn’t gonna put my customers through that anymore,negative
i sold my xbox one x a few months ago on ebay and whew this video makes it seem like i really sold mine for far far too cheap im one of those people that keeps everything including the foam wrap plastic bags and twist ties so the console looks pretty darn good once i get it all back together i can imagine that the only reason youd want to buy from gamestop is just the ease if something is wrong and familiarity also they dont know me but they know gamestop,positive
i worked at gamestop for 5 years and that is by far one of the most unacceptable packing jobs i’ve seen the first console you opened was likely in terrible shape when it was traded in it’s common for those refurbished ones to have panels replaced or be opened up and fixed from the inside out i bet it’s missing the rubber pieces on the bottom because it’s been resurfaced in some way the second console was likely just a trade in tested by an employee for under 5 minutes with these consoles very little is done before they’re repackaged and sold,negative
something to keep in mind i had to replace the thermal past and pads because the home screens of most games were enough to make it over heat and power off,neutral
i used to work in a used game store we would refurbish gamestop refurbished consoles literally daily from people who had them for just a little over a month gamestop refurbishes are known for taking shortcuts at every possible turn and using the cheapest replacement parts available we had a local gamestop that was notorious for ignoring thermal paste on literally everything they did so much so we put out a social media post letting everyone in our area know we would redo the thermal paste in any gamestop console they purchased within a week with proof for 10 fuck gamestop,neutral
i used to work at gamestop and i can say they didnt give us enough packing supplies to ship out orders,negative
i work at gamestop and we arent supposed to package it like that the price is high cause we are low supply of consoles but everything else is pretty accurate ahaha,neutral
fyi for those of us who miss out on a sale by a few daysif an item goes on sale a few days after you bought it just call up customer service and politely ask for a partial refund gamestop is usually pretty good about giving you the difference in cost between what you paid and the current price of the console,neutral
i hope there will be more games hitting 120fps at at least 1440p if not with the series x then definately release a pro midgen refresh asap,positive
i would love to see a series x pro version with a bit more power to run flight simulator properly especially with so many addons that tax the system and a increase in fps for flight sim would be great,positive
i think a pro series x with wifi 6 and more powerful chip would be nice they could keep the same ssd,positive
a pro version of the xbox and playstation is something that isnt needed they are still making cross generation games leading into the end of 2022 and possibly 2023 if there is going to be a refresh it may not be until 2025 or 2026,neutral
i think game pass will have 35 million subscribers at the end of next year all the game releases and activisionblizzard games in game pass will surely add alot to it,positive
its nice to see a channel dedicated to xbox so many other channels are all about the switch or ps4 and 5 ive always been a huge xbox fan and i love my series x,positive
the medium ground of these two consoles would probably be a xbox series x sized console or thinner but slightly more powerful than the series x is,positive
im a huge playstation fan picked up the ps5 day 1 i just picked up a series x a few days ago and i gotta say im pretty damn impressed get both if you can,positive
might be longer for a ps6 or a xbox series y considering the economical structure has crumbled over the years and technology has peaked for large leaps we just need better games better game optimization and better engines for games,neutral
i am all for a series s plus having a disc drive and more storrage must buy,positive
i subscribed,neutral
was very interested in redfall when announced loving the new details and thought put into the game a day one for me even if on gamepass,positive
gamepass is such an amazing servicei mean at first it was ok but now and next year …wowcan’t wait for all these games to release day one,positive
the reason they said large and open space instead of largest map is because if you look at their past games and you measure the square footages of every location and put them together that may be bigger none of their past games have had an open world their other games usually have one big world segmented into multiple locations in this game its actually one open world so its the largest open space of any game they created and they did say that this open world is bigger than prey,neutral
there is no loop hole for how death stranding made it to game pass pc as some have already commented 505 owns the pc rights so theyre free to put it on anything they want sony owns the console rights to ds so this is why it will probably never come to xbox consoles unfortunately,negative
redfall is going to be sick ,positive
hell yeah cant wait for gamescom,positive
game pass has been a great service for me i love all the games that come day one that save me so much money by not having to even buy them it’s great,positive
i play on pc ive been a console gamer forever since 1985 but i built a pc recently with an 11600k and a 3070ti i play my xbox on pc i call it my series pc redfall is looking awesome,positive
dang they are sweating the details that looks fun and the fact you can solo play awesome,positive
even though i dont have children or any family members who have an xbox series s or x i think the family plan is a great deal i am cool with paying the 15 a month for just myself though,positive
this is awesome i can’t believe they’re doing it as they have no real monetary reason to do it other than consumer good grace,positive
personally im stoked for the family plan,positive
that makes sense that they are going into the holiday season that they want to maximize any sales for that so that is really only going to be like 3 months only,neutral
would be nice if the family plan had different levels that we could pay for so we can pay for how many people we want to share with in our family so if i only have 1 person i want to share with then it should be cheaper than a family plan that allows 5 people to sharethis would be great imo,positive
this is such a great feature,positive
series s game pass is the most fun ive had with gaming in many years,positive
if only microsoft has a phone plan for all carriers honestly i saw it was for verizon but i want it for boost mobile so u could pay your phone plan and including the plan with a monthly xbox live service so every month u could just plan your phone bill and be able to play on xbox,positive
i want my xbox s to be a always online server for gaming and with the new deal with unity maybe some game dev oooooo,positive
well we do have some really bad ass games on game pass already and if they aint planning any new additions this yr we should be good honestly its not a big deal for me personally  i run both xbox series s and x which honestly its been more series s than the x and ps5 so im good on games lol  dude i have thousands of games already on both platforms  so yea and atm im back on forza horizon 4 and 5 and elden ring and dark souls 3 and demon souls remake so ill be busy for a while so if they wanna sort things out for us on gp im ok and im sure many of us are xbox has been really good to us ya know they take a huge hit just for us to have fun and thats why i love xbox they truly try to help us out with lowering the prices of the series s and x and keeping game pass cheap and keeping a ton of games on it yeah games on xbox store is higher than picking up the disk for ps4 n ps5 ect but still they do good by us with game pass n the cheap as hell monthly bill and the already low price of the series s n x and i dont understand why ppl are shit talking the series s dude i love mine i have 3 of em   and it can do 4k microsoft already said it does lmao and all ya gotta do is when you plug it up to your tv go to settings display settings and select 4k 60hz or 4k 120hz what ever your tv or monitor does and then start a game and then take the tv remote and hit the ok button your tv will tell you what the series s is putting out to it mine shows 4k 60hz hdr10 dd and the games look beautiful and smooth yeah its not as nice as the series x but its def not 1080p its a higher resolution 100 and i dont see how someone can get 1080p by looking at it lol 1080p dont look that damn sharp n good lmao and just look at the ps4 pro specs the ps4 pro is a 4k correct well the series s has better specs has better hardware the same or a lil more tflops as well the series is is a zen 2 which is a amd 3k series a rtx machine it will do 4k just not as well as its bigger brother the x,positive
who else remembers the good ol’ days when 360 was popular,neutral
045 i miss this i used to play a lot of halo with my brothers i was 6 or 7 back then and never realized just how good i had it this sound kinda just sums up my amazing childhood and the golden age of gaming that just isn’t the same nowadays,positive
046 this this is it this gave me so many memories,positive
the good ol’ memories of the og xbox and 360 startup ahh good times,positive
the 2001 original xbox was my first one got it in 2004 though because i havent heard of it until the fall of 2003 from my uncle besides halo now here i am at 25 still loving it,positive
045 one of the best sounds to hear as a kid,positive
that og 360 startup was sooo fresh as a kid,positive
i was 6 years old and would spend hours watching my brothers play skyrim cod black ops 2 multiplayerzombies prince of persia minecraft batman dead space black ops 2 holds a very special place in my heart even tho i never really got to play those games just watching my brothers play em was fun enough for me i would do anything to go back to those days to get excited whenever i heard the xbox start up sound even tho i couldnt play games till i was older just watching my brothers gaming adventures and playing online with my other brothers that was fun enough for me brings back alot of nostalgic memories,positive
045 the nostalgia from this sound alone makes me want to cry,positive
i still own my xbox 360 because there are games i still enjoyed playing from them the startup still sounds breathtaking,positive

your ingenuity and resourcefulness driven by your creativity is every bit as impressive as the video content and video quality im glad i found your channel this was super fun you put the same effort and creativity into the video as you do the project no wonder you have over one and a half million subs seriously you should be super proud awesome job friend thanks so much for the content 3,positive

i’ve seen some mad stuff in my time but you literally took the saying “1 persons junk is another ones treasure” and turned it into something awesome video presentation is engaging and fun i really enjoyed that video ,positive
martina you are so inspiring and i love the way you are doing this stuff with so much fun,positive
insanely cool using old rubbish and second hand items is also very admirable and cost effective i imagine,positive

i feel like that piano was the most fun i have seen you guys have in a long time,positive
everytime i watch austin and his team i feel like theyre a bunch of nerds assembled i love it ,positive
the piano mat was made famous by the movie big i was waiting for a big reference in the product screenshot it even was labeled the big piano then ken said he wanted to play chopsticks that’s the song that was used on that mat for a whole sequence in the movie and since then anyone who’s ever tried to step on one of these mats tries to mimic that scene in that movie then…you guys reference home alone 2 instead lol,neutral
that was one of the more fun mystery techs for ages,positive

26 years self employed in the same trade within the uk and have to agree some customers are a pain good job ,neutral
the way you remain calm and tell it as it is makes this brilliant to watch,positive
great video towards the end when you talked about the customer that brought the device back for something else i greatly like the metaphors you gave him such as the mechanic ive only have one customer that did that to me and i told him as gently as possible to never darken the entry to my shop with his shadow again nice to hear your kinder way to approach this,positive
more over alex exposing us to a lead solder smell and grinding dust,negative
reminds me of that customer who said “the screen works” and when you plugged it in in front of them it miraculously seemed to have stopped working during the customers trip to the shop i remember years ago my friend had an old nokia dropped off as it was under warranty he reported it simply “stopped working” when taken apart it was soaked with water internally all the markers were bright red you could even see condensation on the inside of the screen yet according to the customer it was never exposed to water and he was trying to scam him out of his warranty… customers will be customers thankfully many are honest,neutral
the fact you use your own equipment to test that the board worked is a testament to the quality of your service the customer mailed you a board i would of just mailed it back after the repair,neutral
great story on the ps4 fix with the controller problem afterwards had these kind of situation so much at my previous job,positive
amazing work great fix you just cant help some customers you have to ignore that so you dont get too annoyed about it its enough if you have to get angry about such statements this is also a learning process like your example with the uv light over the camera just dont think about it too much great video thank you,positive
excellent repair i few years back i did a repair on a computer with a broken sata port i replaced the port and the system ran fine a year and a half later the same customer comes in saying that his data storage hard drive wasnt working im like okay i asked did he want data recover service he said it was working fine and that i was the last person to touch the computer so it must have been something id done i keep snap shots of before and after repairs of my work and keep a printout with all my work orders i said to him that his system didnt even have an hdd in it when it was repaired and only had one ssd in it he mumbled something and said hed just take his business elsewhere i know the vast majority of people reading this are either in the electronics repair business or are hobbyists but i have a serious question to people whod just be regular customers if you had something repaired a year or more ago and something else went wrong unrelated to the original problem would you seriously bring it back to the repair shop expecting that it would get fixed for free im hoping this question doesnt come out as snarky or sarcastic its a sincere question id like to have answered,neutral

honestly i think google apple amazon and facebook should really ramp up there cloud system for games and lure game developers to release games on there cloud stadia could have done better,positive
i’d rather have games be delayed for as long as it’s necessary to make them as good and as bugfree as possible they should just stop announcing games until they’re nearing completion instead of hyping up something up when it’s merely a concept or in early development not announcing a date then rushing to meet that deadline,neutral

fun fact did you know the towers in the playstation 2 start up represent the amount of save files you have on your memory card the more games you played and saved the more block towers youll see,neutral
hearing the 360 always gives me a huge load of nostalgia,positive
the nes snes and n64 had no builtin startup but most official nintendo games would add those in if you inserted a cartridge the spinning n that made the n64 famous would differ between games for example and was sometimes differently and even wrongly colored furthermore the gb and gbc also had a startup that you didnt inlcude and the dsi system had a different startup from the original lastly the gamecube had a 3rd startup version where the soundbites would change to japanese chanting and shamisens but it would only fire if you pressed the zbutton on 4 connected controllers at the same time,neutral
the ps2 start up gives me goosebumps every time that was my childhood edit and gamecube almost forgot about that one,positive
10 years from now all these startups are going to be extremely nostalgic,positive

gaz is spot on in regards to xbox marketing it is an xbox problem and their marketing in many european countries is either nonexistent or incredibly limited they have a good product with a good service and software yet in many europeans markets they are being outsold 101 because they either dont know how or where to market their product or their budget is super limited,negative
thanks for a other great show guys ,positive
i have a feeling perfect dark will nail the future forward atmosphere that was what i wanted from initiative in the 1st place something new and refreshing,positive
the reason the digital and physical games cost the same is because the retail stores thru a fit if people could buy the digital game cheaper the stores would be stuck with the disks,negative
hey guys love your work i went to preorder modern warfare 2 from the xbox store yesterday and was quite surprised to find that it’s priced at £6995 have you covered this i think it may be the first £70 xbox game i’ve come across,positive
when a game says their new game is bigger than their last game the people whining saying a bigger map means the game wont be dense are just complaining to complain they do not know shit if the game is more dense or not that is just a deflection of an actual reaction or thought with any real substance i guess i am just sick of these people who are sick of studios being proud of making their games bigger than their previous if the game is not out or being played by reviewers at least then lets just be patient and wait until we are playing it instead of saying some bs comments are are being made up out of complete guesses pretty much i truly like how gaz does not hold back on any side playstation or xbox n will tell it how it is that is refreshing but him bitching about the red fall map when he didnt even watch the new 21 minute video the studio put out plus their was some new shit being show so i dont even know what colt was complaining about that arkane did not show anything new in the video when they had the chance to or whatever he was saying,negative
capping for higher priced games is like saying youre happy to pay more at the pump because the want to support the people working at the refinery,neutral
im a gamer of all consoles i have only ever had to do one return and it was on playstation had my money back in my account in about 45 minutes i was surprised love gamepass have a great day ,positive
id could make a good blade or arkane they did a great job on dishonored prey deathloop,positive
you did a great work with this new makeover colt and gaz look incredible now see i did say it will be clean and niiice  the audio sounds alot better imo now xstalkerx dk on xbox,positive
i think in the future the value of having the series x will grow exponentially when you look at the number of studios microsoft has been acquiring and with fewer cross gen titles limiting devs from using the full power of the next gen consoles,positive
i’m very happy with my series s and i’ve been all about physical media before i got it i do plan on getting a series x eventually but i’ve just been playing digital games on my xbox one most of the time because of game pass ultimate after thinking about it i realized my physical library on xbone was substantially smaller than my ps4 library or switch library so i didn’t really feel bad about getting the series s and an external hard drive even though my 360 library was pretty big i’ve been able to get a lot of my favorites on sale for like 3 each digitally when the series x becomes more available and becomes a bit cheaper i’ll get one but for now i’m really enjoying my series s,positive
as someone on a budget the series s is great game pass makes it really great especially with the deals u can get and just using external hard drives are a better option because transferring games is better than paying half the price of the console for the ssd so yeah if u have more money maybe get the series x but it just depends on ur situation,positive
i have a decent amount of physical games from the original xbox 360 and one so i feel justified getting the series x especially because it has superior fps at 4k resolution the problem right now is many games are cross gen so nothings really pushed the series x to its limits yet if you still have a one x and plan to get a series x later and can wait you can update the internal hdd to a sdd on the one x it’ll load games twice as fast as before but still probably twice as long as the series s the one x has a better graphics card than the series s previous games optimized for the one x will look better on the one x than on the series s however cross platform games are probably going to have a better fps than the x do to the better cpu there’s a lot that goes into this stuff another factor to consider is the quality of your tv i’ll be looking to pair my series x with a new oled tv here soon and then i’m 200 sure i’ll feel justified with the purchase also i game a lot so 30 60 120 frames a second… i notice the difference and in no way shape or form would i feel justified having a next gen console series s that can’t even keep up with my old 4k tv,positive
it really depends on what your main platform is if your main is playstation ive seen a lot go with the series s to get the exclusives most that main a ps5 dont want to pay the extra,neutral
thank you for sharing your experience with these consoles and not fan boying speaking your truth will help alot of people who are on a budget people constantly spread the narrative of digital games are horrible but why when the majority of the world doesnt but movies or music im all for digital downloads and will only purchase physical games if its attached to a special edition that im truly a fan of,positive
in your own words do i really want an xbox no do i really need an xbox no but i feel like i work hard and i deserve it in reality since the day you stepped onto the xbox series platform you have been trying to convince yourself that you need something you didnt really want thats foolish logic the next time you dont want something dont buy it because you think you work hard and deserve it,negative
i dont have a series x yet and although series s is a great console the fact is all digital is a no go for me the reason is that i have a good collection of xbox 360 and xbox one physical games and some of them such as older forza horizon or forza motorsport games are not available to buy digitally anymore due to license issues so the only way of playing those games is using the disc i would be happy with a series so with disc drive but as this is not an option ill have to go with the series x another point is that although gamepass is great i had it for two years and experienced great games including halo infinite i think it is a bit too expensive if it was 80 per year as the live gold was it would be a no brainer but at 15 per month 180 per year i think it is too expensive you can use that money and buy over 7 aaa games on physical or digital sale for that price assuming an average cost of 25 per game,neutral
i bought a series s when it first came out and a 3 year gamepass subscription was pretty impressed with the little beast but soon ran into the lack of free space to install games so i decided to sell the s and buy the series x had the x now for a year but the other day i suddenly realised that i hadnt turned on my series x for a week and before that it was just sporadically so decided to sell but i didnt want to completely move away from gaming and i managed to find an absolute awesome deal on a series s 140 euros with 2 controllers and 1 of those controllers is the 20th anniversary edition going to sell that which will make my series s end price probably around 60 euros cant get better than that for casual gamers like myself the series s is a fantastic console,positive
big mistake i own both the x box series x and ps 5 and alot of the older games from previous gen releases run and look alot better on the x box series x even some of the current gen titles look better on x box series x also microsofts recent buy outs with bethesda activision and potentially other gaming software companies means future releases like cod and skyrim releases may be x box series x exclusives,positive
got my series x on friday and i’m really impressed with it the visuals are jaw dropping,positive
i went from a one s to the series x and the jump to 4k 60fps is pretty significant everything feels much smoother and everything loads faster thank god for ssds the only issue is that there arent really any games out right now designed specifically for the series x with the exception of the medium aha,positive
ive been a lifelong playstation fan but after looking at the beauty and power of the new series x i just may get one im enjoying the ps5 too,positive
as a huge playstation fan that packaging is another level ,positive
i’ve had my series x for a week and i’m still in love with it the visuals and overall gameplay of the games are amazing i can’t stop playing microsoft flight sim because of how beautiful it looks and how well the console runs the game strongly recommend if your an xbox fan,positive
great job here man that is so beautifully lit filmed and cut it looks literally perfect would you ever consider making some tips how to film like that re the series x its such a shame supply sucks ive been lucky enough to source one but its such a wonderful machine that should be in so many more houses,positive
just got the xbox and my friend got the ps5 and honestly they did amazing with both consoles it’s at the point in time that it doesn’t really matter what system you have unless u want exclusives all games now a days are crossplay love both systems ,positive
thanks really helpful i just got my xbox one series x and like how you walked through the unboxing and setup,positive
i wonder if i killed the unboxing experience for myself after watching every single unboxing and review on youtube lol,negative

when you refill batteries on the remoteit just feels like reloading a shotgun ,neutral
you know you can just get rechargeable ones for xbox i have two and it’s great some people just like using batteries but every one is different,positive
yeah but if you buy a rechargeable battery pack for the xb controller you can actually charge it up using your same charger that your phone uses plugged into the wall the ps controller will only charge when it’s connected directly to the console,neutral
little does he know it takes an hour for full charge,neutral
ive been using rechargeable batteries for over 12 years and i can use them for other electronics as well,positive
bro there is a charging port on the xbox ,neutral
you know if you just spend an extra 1020 you can buy rechargeable batteries for xbox controllers ,positive
i hope for the sake of not feeling embarrassed for you that you’re not trying to imply the controller with less opinions is a better solution when you can plug in the xbox controller as well put in batteries or do what every smart person does and insert rechargeable batteries ,neutral
you know you can just get rechargeable ones for xbox i haver two and its great some people just like using batteries but every one different,positive
man put batteries in the wrong way,negative
as a playstation fan i really hope the deal goes through they’ve relied on cod marketing to boost their sales since the beginning of the last gen sony will have to innovate and become more attractive in other more interesting things than cod,positive
this is ridiculous does sony not understand the deal is going through no matter what it’s business playstation does it all the time,negative
i personally like that xbox is being so aggressive i got tired of them playing nice a long time ago especially considering that sony has never extended to them the same courtesy,negative
the part at 500 explains it clearly this is why i have such a huge problem with sony right now the sense of entitlement and pettiness coming from them is infuriating seems like this is all about gamepass and other moves by ms changing the industry and now sony is upset because they have to compete on more even ground and are resentful about it,negative
thats the console war we need this kind of competition gets the best out of both companies and it means ws for all of us consumers,positive
i primary play on ps but recently got back into xbox for the first time since xbox 360 so i’m happy to see xbox actually do well because it pushes sony to do better when i see twitter i see so much venom from both sides and it’s super sad to see i just love video games man why can’t we just enjoy it,positive
i have both playstation and xbox and i like how this competitive climate is forcing change on both sides microsoft was foundering during the last generation so they introduced game pass which forced sony to step up their game with ps plus competition ultimately benefits the consumer things are getting spicy with these acquisitions but being on both platforms im content to let them duke it out for my money,positive
boy that escalated quickly i mean that really got out of hand fast – ron burgundy,negative
you gotta love how most of sony’s arguments boil down to “we’re scared that microsoft will not allow cod on playstation and we know we will lose 50 of our player base over it” meanwhile exclusivity is their whole business model,neutral
documents like this are why microsoft have the best lawyers in the world they go through it with a fine tooth comb and they’re like “yep send it”,positive

for the past year i’ve only had a nintendo switch i’m a playstation guy but found the series’s s at an incredibly low price so i had to buy it so far next gen gaming is great and this video is a big help to someone like me who is not only new to next gen but xbox in general thank you,positive
a few of these are applicable to xbox one and have been for a couple of years especially the googlealexa voice control and the app based functions i didnt know about programming universal remotes to your xbox thats cool,positive
kudos to people like you who make videos like this to inform people of what theyre missing,positive
these consoles are so impressive it’s like “if you know you know” so underrated,positive
i’m so glad i managed to get a series x had it about a year now and love it have not played games since the xbox 360 days and i can say it’s a massive leap haha,positive
this was extremely informative great information ,positive
i noticed when looking at my recent captures in the xbox series s that some of the screenshots on 4k games claim to be 4k or in some instance 4k hdr which i thought was interesting,positive
thanks for such informative video i just got a series x few days ago and i’ve learnt many new things from you video appreciate the effort,positive
half of this applies to the xbox one already some is cool and new though,positive
on the series x i hate how if you have a enhanced game saved somewhere other than the internal or the hard drive for the back it will always want too update the same games over and over,negative
the fact they managed to get lies of p into game pass day one is nuts at this point xbox can damn near get any 3rd party game into game pass,positive
microsoft is helping developers financially to get their games finished and out to millions of people sony is not doing that at all and people are clocking on to it and shifting to xbox especially when cod is on game pass every time a new one comes out,neutral
you know dirt i can honestly say im literally overwhelmed with good games on games pass just finished sniper elite 5 loved it bout to play thymesia and midnight fight express and i absolutely know its going to get even better in the months to come great video brother keeping it real as usual thanks,positive
almost every industry is going subscription based why wouldnt gaming its going to happen and at least microsoft is at the helm and doing it right i feel completely respected as a consumer and it seems to me to be healthy for gaming,positive
microsoft acquiring these studios is t just about games its about the new virtual metaverse micosoft and zuckerburg are trying to build and having companies that already work in this industry will pay massive dividends later,positive
still cant believe sony is crying over games going to xbox gamepass you cant make this stuff up,negative
i had to explain to ponies that netflix isnt like game pass when netflix has a new show you can only watch it on netflix when starfield is on game pass its not just on game pass you can buy it digital or physical you can play it on console pc or streaming they think they are comparable and when netflix loses subscribers they try and say same thing will happen with game pass because they are the same,neutral
its about the cash tencent makes more revenue annually than both xbox and nintendo combined and they make zero exclusives and saying you pay more to support the devs is like saying youre glad to pay more at the gas pump so you can support exxon and the people working at the refineries its so dumb,negative
sony had a 26 drop in software sales and had to lower sales expectations for 2022 they arent even supporting the developers themselves,negative
good to see aa and aaa games coming day one to gamepass thats what real gamers want to see not these pissy little indie garbage like cooking simulator microsoft gamepass was firing on all cylinders in 2021 they need to bring that energy back because 2022 has been a very weak year for xbo but atleast they got us looking forward to 2023 ps high on life was delayed its not 2022 anymore i believe,positive

personally play on xbox series s on keyboard and mouse definitely took a while to get used to especially aiming mouse acceleration is extremely difficult to master but i have decent piece and can triple edit now takes a while to learn though,neutral
in this the only thing you find out is who the better players are that doesnt mean the player that won his console is better that just means the player is better overall am just sayin,positive
you should do one of these but with worse console players to see whos better all around,neutral
ngl i’m enjoying this videos a lot i think u should do more console it switches things up instead of playing with pc players this better entertainment keep it up,positive
the reason for the input delay is obtain the drivers windows is owned by microsoft with xbox too so drivers are found much easier than sonys way of obtaining drivers,positive
series x has been great for me with variable refresh rate and 120fps it is a massive improvement in performance than my previous one x,positive
i love when jerian makes videos like this ,positive
i think once developers start to use velocity architecture mesh shaders direct storage fsr20 vrs20 the full toolset then we will see some amazing results from this little beaut especially as the biggest issue is lack or ram which with direct storage n velocity they will able to use the ssd as a virtual ram pool the console has a lot of potential but depends if the developers use the toolset available to them when the features become available especially as we know the gdk is new for this gen and a lot of features are still being developed and improved upon,positive
comparing the switch and the series s is a good way to explain what it is both have a more accessible price but the difference is that series s has a lot more power and features but cannot be used portable in a convenient way it depends what you needwant at that price point,neutral
i think the implementation of fsr 20 and the evolution of upscaling technologies will enable the series s to stay relevant the third pearly thing is a concert but i think it’s more of a problem with games made for the previous systems ie ace combat 7,neutral
i think for the price i got mine used for 180 euros paired with a nice 24 1080p ips monitor the series s is very good value as you said i have found forza fsx and halo to run great to your point regarding storage space i also agree that just having space for the couple of games you are currently playing is perfect on previous xbox consoles i would find id fill up the hdd with loads of games due to game pass and a few other purchases and never got time to play them properly oh lets not forget the series s is a fantastic emulation box more than capable of running many consoles,positive
i have a pc with a 3060 in it i have a nintendo switch and i have a series s i have never had an issue with how the series s runs games because my xbox is mostly for game pass and games that run perfectly fine on the console like nba 2k optimizations for new console generations take quite some time and im patient and it is not a new issue the ps4 had its issues the xbox one x had its issues they were fixed people complaining should calm down,positive
for weeks i was using the series s as my main console unintentionally because it turned out that i was playing more where i thought i would play less i had no complaints it was really good i eventually switched but its not like i felt there was much of a problem,positive
i got both i got the sx in my living room and the ss in my guest room the sx is my primary gaming machine while the ss is setup to be more of a streaming device even if the ss gets left behind because of gaming advancement it still holds value as a multimedia device,positive
i bought my series s on 21st jul 2022 its my first console ever and been almost a month since i got it i absolutely love it idk why i see people complaining about the resolution i got it plugged in on my 4k 55 tv and boy games look amazing i have been playing halo infinite forza horizon 5 fifa 22 hades two point campus ori and the wisp turbo golf racing and after all these games i still have around 143 gb left so no complaints about storage either i am totally enjoying it,positive
i absolutely love the portability of the series s,positive
these next gen consoles shouldve shipped with more storage to begin with especially considering theyre backwards compatible with last gen but atleast xbox lets you connect more then 1 storage device if you dont mind moving games id suggest getting an ultra small flashdrive like the sandisk ultra fit you can easily fit 2 on the back usb ports on the xbox giving up to 1tb of more storage while still having room the expandable sdd too plus you can play the older xbox one games off the flashdrive sure you can do the same thing with a normal harddrive however using an ultra small flashdrive takes up no extra space meaning its easier to fit in an entertainment center plus it makes it easier if you move your console often,positive
quick resume is a god tier feature pc my main platform but damn the quick resume on my series s is something else brilliant for getting in quick games before work when youve not got much time,positive
im just happy to get constant improvement to the system big pat on the back microsoft for doing this,positive
the only negative i’ve had with streaming a game is the image quality can be quite lacking some games look better than others tho you can’t beat downloading every graphic related file,negative
great video today ray i enjoy many of your videos to get my xbox fix nice interview today i love seeing a dev’s perspective on their work or other games on the market keep up the great work dude,positive
props to microsoft they are truly killing it this generation hopefully sony will step up their game instead of slacking behind the entire time or even better drop their exclusives on pc day 1 with another subscription,positive
think of the way ps2 got into a lot of house holds the dvd player that dvd player turned a lot of movie watchers into video game players xbox being on a tv with gamepass could be another trojan horse brining in new gamers keeping video games around that much longer,neutral
one very unrelated subject that annoys me even though i would love that every game had the play anywhere feature i get microsoft can’t really force third party companies like ubisoft to jumó aboard they make a lot of money from people having to rebuy the same game but atleast there should be a way to keep your progress i jumped from xbox series x to a mega high end pc build and i have lost every single bit of progress i had in every gamr,negative
i think its a good game but not all games need to have new stuff all the time,positive
i have a 22 ultra i use for emulation and cloud gamingstreaming my series x with wifi 6 and controller plugged in fh5 has been very very playable compared to even a few months ago and i’ve had a blast on the go with rpgs like kh3 etc it’s so very close we are almost there guys,positive
if you were concerned about the loss of ownership with regards to software and game pass type services the streaming game service should terrify you streaming service makes sure that only the provider controls your content,negative
thanks to everyone who sent me this topic and for liking the video 3,positive
lets look at this from a consumer point of view paying developers a fee for timed exclusive is one thing no big deal thats just how the business is obviously you need a reason for customers to want to buy your console but for sony to intentionally go out of there way to essentially bribe multiple 3rd party developers to block a game ever going to gamepass and to ensure the customer continues to pay full price on there platform instead because they know they cant compete with it is about as anti consumer and monopoly driven as you can get and they have the nerve to call the activition deal harmful to the gaming industry  talk about the pot calling the kettle black  sony has no answer to gamepass there whole business model is about making mass profits out of there customers and making them think they cant go anywhere else this is simply sony running scared and trying to limit the damage to the profits they are inevitably going to lose from cod but i guarantee if sony were big enough of a company to buy activition themselves they would have done it in a heartbeat and you bet your bottom dollar they wouldnt leave cod multiplatform its apparently one rule for everyone else but completely another for sony  hypocrisy at its best,negative
they hurt xbox lol from where im sitting it looks like xbox is landing repeated lightning screw uppercuts on sony lately but maybe im wrong,neutral
bra sony be tripping games in europe are 80 euros lmao,neutral
pretty scummy on sonys part on this one the game wars are always fair game tactics until you do practices that deliberately sabotage the competition ms doesnt need the console exclusivity as game pass is on pc as well so they just want those subsriptions,negative
sony pulling an epic games store interesting,neutral
i understand if you pay for exclusive games on your platform then it should not be on your competitor subscription service but blocking 3rd party multi platform games is shitty,negative
i didn’t even know gamepass had more potential until i learned that they are preventing it from having a lot of games ugh it used to be ridiculous to think that dvd blue ray would stop being a thing when videos went to netflix hulu and etc but i think that’s the future of social media anyways just my opinion,negative
imo whats most interesting here is really the studios themselves and what exactly theyre hoping to get out of these deals everyone knows that it takes at least 2 parties being in agreement to make a partnership and most of these 3rd party studios are going to chase money but then what i have to wonder is if gamepass would be such a good deal for large dev studios then why wouldnt they turn down ps in theory gamepass should be attractive for devs by offering them an upfront check just to add their games while also giving them exposure to new fans who otherwise might not buy into their properties weve also seen plenty of evidence that xbox is swimming in microsoft money so they should easily have the means to outbid sony for games they want on their service as well as typical console exclusives for that matter yet we have numerous examples of studios regularly agreeing to sonys deals and stipulations if a studio wanted to join gp and told sony they would decline their gp restriction contract i can see them getting less marketing on ps but i highly doubt sony wouldnt want their sales cultural reasons and brand loyalty may be a factor for why some of these studios go with sony but i dont know if that would be a big enough reason for them to potentially sacrifice their bottom line it just seems to me like somehow many studios arent jumping at the bit to put some of their big games on gamepass and are more comfortable getting paid to stay off it that or gp isnt as good of a deal for various dev studios as many of us think no shade at gp i love it just saying i dont get how ms would be losing out to sonys contracts to stay off it unless they offer too few incentives to join it in the first place,positive
its quite obvious to me that sony fears microsoft thats why they keep blocking games from going to xbox what the heck is wrong with a game coming out to all consoles so that everyone can play grow up sony and mind your own business model and not what someone else is doing,negative
im huge xbox fan but honestly there has been barely anything outside 3rd party mostly been playing old games but next 2 years from this point has huge potential i want to see avowed already my most anticipated xbox game also forza motorsport will be first next gen experience on xbox i belive,positive
my favorite xbox series accessorie is the pdp media remote ive had it for about 6 months and its great especially for the price got it for 10 on sale on amazon and they are i think 20 or 25 now worth every penny unlike the series 2 i bought its a great controller as well scince they have fixed some of the reliability issues in the newer ones however the price is still to much if your lucky like i was you can find one refurbished for 150 if thats a risk your willing to take buying refurbished,positive
you should be able to toggle off and on quick resume for particular tiles there needs to be more tile control in general,neutral
ive had an xbox 360 for 8 yrs it just recently started overheating it still works but i went straight for the series x all access is 3708 a month for 2 yrs for the console a controller and a 2 yr game pass ultimate subscription ive been running it off my hotspot works great console and cloud gaming thank god my internet will be fixed this week,positive
to be honest unless you have a tv that can do 4k 120hz theres no point thinking about the future pro versions 4k 60hz doesnt push the series x so no point upgrading if you dont have a top of the line tv,neutral
i really wish they would beef up the storage on the s for its current price a 1tb xbox x is the same price as an s with a 1tb expansion makes it way less appealing granted you end up with a little more storage that way but also less capability in the s overall i feel if it wasnt for the whole world collectively crapping itself over the last couple yrs last gen would have already been put out to pasture as it stands theres not enough current gen owners to pull that trigger yet so games have this half in half out feel hopefully production ramps up for ps and xbox so we can leave last gen behind,negative
i see a lot of comments from people upset about next gen games not really happening yetwe cant really blame microsoft for that though we have to look at the devs and ask them why theyre continuing to support older hardware instead of trying to focus on the newer ones most likely to due with the limited availability the last couple of years but still now is the time they should be focusing on series sx,neutral
i would say that the best thing about the xbox2 aka series sx are the memory cards theyre convenient swappable with the size that aaa even some aa games are coming at these days i view them as essential with the ps5 id have to get at a bare minimum a 2 tb which isnt swappable,positive
if we could just get support for older games to run at higher frame rates and resolutions that would be amazing,positive
its pretty ridiculous that microsoft is looking towards upgrading systems especially with it being hard to get the new consoles now neither company should be focused on pro consoles until the series x and ps5 have been out and have reached their full potential,negative
i just bought my first xbox system 3 weeks ago series s and their game pass is awesome ive already tried about 15 games and found some games i would have never tried such as as dusk falls which i enjoyed,positive
literally just bought my series x two days ago and it arrives later this day im genuinely so excited as this seems to be with all the acquisitions and new games being added its going to be the decade of the xbox heres to hoping for a bright future,positive
cant wait to see an xbox at best buy target or walmart ah the old days,positive
i wonder if there will be options for family plans like i have one sister my parents havent played video games since the 80s so a two family plan id like but i could also work with a 4 person plan just have me pay my share my sister pay me hers and my best friend and his girlfriend pay me for theirs that way everyone wins with lower priced game pass costs i hope its that flexible you know,neutral
i feel you on the cost of the pro series controller i have one of the series 1 pro controllers which i bought used and frankly i was disappointed that after i had been using it a while the rubber on the sides began to warp and peel i had to buy third party replacement parts to swap out the little plates right there because xbox doesnt offer their own replacement parts which i find kinda lame considering the rubber warping was a fairly common issue to be honest i would prefer if they had an option to buy it with the plastic plates rather than the rubber ones cause that issue isnt going to go away after using the controller for an extended amount of time the paddles are nice and all but i can buy like 3 games for the cost or i can buy a third party controller from scrub for less and get the same functionality out of it but hey to each their own what i would really love is the ability to make a custom pro controller in their design lab i would pay extra for that but as it stands right now ill stick with my standard series x controller ,negative
im beginning to lean more and more towards the opinion that the initiative was always going to be partnering up with a bigger more experienced studio from the getgo maybe they had plans to do this originally with certain affinity as its been confirmed that massive support studio was working with the initiative from the earliest days most likely on a prototype but it looks like gallagher went with his old studio crystal dynamics and this was the final straw that caused the schism with a number of the earlier initiative hires but is it really that surprising the initiative wasnt hiring hundreds of devs every year to scale up for a massive aaa project they were hiring like a dozen employees per year instead and even jeff grubb once succinctly put it perfect dark was never going to be made by the initiative pretty sure gallagher and other highups knew if they were going to make an aaa game they were always going to need a large experienced studio to take on most of the workload trying to get that done with a 6575 person team isnt realistic,neutral
if an elite series 3 controller is on the horizon microsoft really needs to focus on quality control i went through 3 series 2 controllers before giving up and getting a refund i experienced faulty paddles loose buzzing rumble motors and worst of all large deadzones on the analog sticks i really wanted to love it but i couldnt warrant spending that kind of money on a controller with basic functionality issues,negative
family plan sounds great miss the old version we had on 360 considering ive bought at least 4 consoles per generation and 4 subscriptions monthly isnt exactly cheap this is possibly the biggest news of this gen for myself,positive
i have the elite series 1 controller still and it was sent into service once for the rubber loosening and a bumper not working correctly the design and thought behind the elite series controllers is awesome but it does require more work done to the design esp after hearing the same rubbergripproblem happens also on series 2 but i also remember microsoft being at first very oppositional to the idea of the free to repair thing but shortly after that they were called in again and microsoft had completely reversed their decision so if a third party repairservice was able to repair anything to my series 1 controller as its been a while since i bought it id be all in favor of it that would just secure the longevity of any controller basically for the foreseeable future and im glad microsoft and xbox is supporting that,neutral
matthew first of all you done a great job with your videos love them all have you seen the recent job offers by bioware the next dragon age seem in a big trouble and i think it will be great to know your opinion best regards from catalonia,positive

ever since ubi started putting games on game pass immortals is the game ive wanted them to drop there i like the art style over the ultra realistic and the mythology based storyline should be perfect for a classic action adventure experience,positive
bruh xbox is literally kicking sonys butt with the game pass and i’m loving it ,positive
plague requiem high on life and moon scars are the ones i’m soo hyped for i love gamepass lets go,positive
edith finch is leaving wow that game has been on gamepass since up first launched if im not mistaken i had just figured it would be a permanent title great game if you like story and want something you can beat fairly quickly for achievements,positive
out of all of these the only one im looking forward too is high on life looks like ill be starting my second play through of kingdom come deliverance and if you havent played it yet and love big open world story driven rpgs with basic survival mechanics and quite different combat mechanics i highly suggest it though its still got a few bugs,positive
a plague tale requiem moonscars high on life also dont sleep on immortals it is a fantastic game and even though im 37 years old dreamlight valley looks great too,positive
great content keep it up,positive

its like a superpower the way linus delivers entertaining and informative commentary so naturally,positive
this doesnt have ray tracing or anything like that but the realism from the sun on the screen from my blinds priceless,positive
love my series x i also love my one x too i honestly didn’t think that there would be much difference boy how wrong i was loadingdownloading times are insane and quick resume is freaking incredible so thankful for that bad boy,positive
the one x is still a very relevant console as it does native 4k on many games even if it is a stable 30fps and even some at 60fps mostly ms titles digital foundry even said graphical differences are very miniscule and for the most part it would take a magnifying glass to spot the differences which is true since ive compared both side by side when they get must have next gen titles only itll probably be worth it as of now the one xand pro are just fine on a 4k display,positive
something that can help with the storage is the new xbox feature which admittedly is only available on games that support it that allows you to delete certain parts of a game maybe you dont want a certain campaign you can delete that and save on space,neutral
hearing linus say its better than a pc in any way you know its an amazing machine,positive
linus lighting can make such a big difference to the perceived realism of an image the big ass glare on the tv yeah linus it really can,neutral
get a personalized video from me on cameo,neutral
i own a series s bought it when the x was impossible to find last year and honestly it runs great yet to see how next gen gaming truly performs on this thing but i havent had a single issue with the machine load times are waaayy faster than the xbox one s and ps4 looks great on my 1440p monitor and when upscaling on 4k tvs gamepass is great the hard drive is a bit small for holding sx optimized games i use an external for everything else stick to performance mode and you will not have any frame rate issues lastly it fits in my backpack if i travel with it this thing is worth every penny imo,positive
more like a 510 performance boost which will allow to push the console just a lil more which could make a world of difference for the series s,positive
more ram being allocated to game devs is nice but it doesn’t solve one of the biggest issues of the series s which is the bandwidth of the memory itself also more ram doesn’t really mean higher frame rates but higher quality textures or assets or increase the distance before you see lod culling it isn’t going to affect frame rate by going from 30 to 60 but it might allow a stuttering inconsistent 30 fps to hold a more locked 30 fps,negative
i hope they continue to get more put of it in the future as well we need to finally leave last gen development behind and focus on the series s as the base for optimization going forward its the perfect 1440p console and it pairs perfectly with 1440p monitors at the moment due to 1440p scaling at launch and a decent internal upscale for older content when displayed on a 1440p monitor you cant touch the value at this price point,positive
about sfs sampler feedback streaming the demo starting at the 50 second mark was configured to run in 4k and each object is a 16k x 16k bc7 texture ordinarily this would take up 350mb of gpu memory for each individual object the demo features 985 such objects which would take up nearly 300 gb yes thats gb not mb of gpu memory however as can be seen in the video allocated vram usage is just over 3 gb and dedicated vram usage is just over 2 gb sfs allows for visuals that simply would not otherwise be possible due to memory constraints,neutral
sony did the same with the ps3 cell processor back in the day the uncharted sequels looked better than the first one because developers were granted access to higher memory,positive
im loving my series s and this is great to hear cant wait to see how far these features along with the rdna2 ones will carry it,positive
they really should be doing more for this console this is the more widely available console opposed to the ps5 and series x,neutral
this is so awesome i travel a ton so i take my series s with me because i wouldnt need to take several cds but i have a small rotation of games im able to play i love this so much,positive
im really excited for hogwarts legacy as that looks like it could be something both fantastic and fresh,positive

they could introduce a group of mutants that has huge ties to the xmen especially wolverine bring in alpha flight and at the end have a cut scene of heather and james on a hunting trip and encountering a wild beast in the woods they dont even have to show his face not revealing who the actor is this could lunch into the xmen movie where xavier is recruiting the new team to battle karoka to rescue the original team they could do flash backs for the first half giving us the true original roster i always fear that the xmen movie will feature the more popular members rather than establishing the original 5 and later havok and polaris i dont mind having the most popular members but stay true to the originals hated when fox screwed it all up and rogue was a villian before joining the xmen,neutral
much in the way they did with spiderman it does help to have fantastic four cast early so they can introduce them in other movies and shows that allows them to introduce the characters and have their audience familiar with them without having to do another origin story for them,positive
we are just so blessed to be living in a time where there’s so much marvel content… i’m a huge fan man been watching for a while now i’m very grateful for the shows movies everything the mcu has brought us thanks for keeping us in the loop as always you’re the ,positive
ff needs an announcement to slowly big that hype with actors and directors for sure thunderbolts is on schedule as much speculation on members and who will be the villains will be i do like the idea of the squadron supreme sinister from another universe as mention in mr romans previous posts,positive
im stoked for f4 casting and while yes its 2 years away it was also announced in 2019 so theyve had 3 years to cast it and im willing to bet they had it cast before watts left the project and they may have them cast early so they can pop up in another film before their solo outing it would make sense for them to show up in quantumania,positive
sounds like a pretty solid lineup i cant imagine them not doing the werewolf by night or guardians holiday special some what but i guess well see,positive
super pumped to see who is coming in f4 full steam ahead with everything thats coming in the thunderbolts kang dynasty secret wars and so much more in the mcu,positive
this is a trailer done correctly not spoiling anything yet still pulling our emotions angela basset is phenomenal and her line got me right in the feels,positive
this movie will be epic definitely break every marvel record when it drops love the cast soundtrack outfits makeup etc wakanda 4eva rip chadwick ,positive
i got goosebumps after listening to this trailer this trailer is really good and full of emotions “i am queen of the most powerful nation in the world and my entire family is gone have i not given everything” that line and the trailer as a whole sent chills down my spine can’t wait to see this,positive
the fact that they included chadwicks death in the story and made it a core part of the drama is a great way for the writers to connect the audience with the movie we all grief chadwick and we are going to see how other people deal with this grief hope the move is as majestic as the music from the trailer,positive
this is not just a teaser its a heartfelt tribute to chadwick boseman,positive
chadwick boseman is the reason were where we are with this sequel you rest in peace my friend you are and always will be our black panther wakanda forever this trailer looks epic,positive
this trailer is so powerful if the trailer can bring you to tears just imagine what the movie will do rip chadwick boseman,positive
this is potentially going to be one of the greatest movies that marvel has put forth this trailer speaks volume and the fact that they did not reveal much is even more fantastic dolby amc opening night i have my eye on you,positive
since day one when this trailer came out i cannot stop watching absolutely phenomenal,positive
honestly i had doubts about this movie and if it should even be made but this trailer changed my mind it’s so powerful and this is now one of my most anticipated marvel movies definitely one of marvels best trailers ever the music the cinematography and emotion incredible,positive
also when it comes to she hulk she said she can control herself when she goes full hulk so that means she was fully aware that her kicking a group of men would have killed them,neutral
as a woman i love this video something felt so off this phase i couldn’t put my finger on it and you explained it perfectly its so insulting for both sexes that what they’re doing is saying that men have to be so stupid and useless in order for women to be strong and smart,negative
you just earned a new sub excellent assessment and commentary wokeness and identity politics is killing movies,neutral
we have to stop telling men that there is no difference between competence and misogyny well said thank you,neutral
the thing that irks me the most is substituting good storytelling and characters for the sake of filling quotas i love seeing diversity it’s a wonderful thing but it shouldn’t come at the expense of someone else or be shoehorned in for the sake of representation just write good stories and good characters it’s remarkably simple,negative
it’s always awesome when someone calls you sexist for not liking she hulk the cgi looks terrible the marvel humor is painfully unfunny and i’m getting lectured because of my genitalia but yes i’m not watching it simply because it has women in it you hit the nail on the head when it comes to representation nobody cares about the character’s identity people only get annoyed when the actors directors and studios start sucking themselves off and act like they’re mlkj’s successor it’s also annoying cuz they flat out refuse to market minority actors in certain countries then turn around and call you an ist for criticizing their product same thing with their messages sure there are some good messages like choosing love and don’t be racist but they do a terrible job of conveying them also i don’t think a corporation that’s constantly getting accused of discriminating against race religion gender ethnicity panders to intolerant international consumers has celebrities attack others for disagreeing with them does business with oppressive governments and films at concentrate camps can talk to people about love and tolerance,negative
i’m a huge marvel fan… can’t wait to see each project this was wonderfully done and beautifully narrated i was hoping other people were feeling this too… it’s bizarre,positive
as an asian who was actually born and brought up in asia i had never felt issues watching western shows and their flawed representation i mean if i want to watch a local movie i would just watch one from my own country as there is no way americans can portray my country and my people better than ourselves this is until i am being lectured about how representation works and how happy i should be watching americans try to act in various races that totally misrepresented them i mean seriously you are telling me your representation of chinese is representing all the worlds chinese that is patronizing as hell because i can tell you there are so many differences between american chinese china chinese and other chinese living in different parts of the world crazy rich asians just made me cringe so hard yes i am from singapore i believe no way home would be the last good mcu movie for a long time ever if not forever tried to watch dr strange 2 but felt like they killed the original dr strange and replaced him with a fake if you want a good representation movie in recent times try everything everywhere all at once great representative movie not because they checked the boxes but their background is actually part of the story showing the struggles the characters experienced due to their background plus the conflict between their cultural background and their current life i mean they even represented rocks who else can top it,negative
when end game was on the horizon i remember being legitimately scared that the writers would make captain marvel kill thanos and single handedly stop his army so thankful they still knew how to write satisfying character arcs for the finale of my favorite franchise the mcu ended with endgame and everything since has just been put on the sacrificial alter of phase 4 feminism though spider man nwh was just a oneoff great movie for me since tobey’s spidey was the first movie i remember seeing in theaters,positive
it sucks how they’ve treated the characters we love so much with such disrespect and replaced them with toxic characters  spiderman is one of my favorite heroes in marvel and honestly like you said these new characters lack any character growth and as such i don’t feel emotionally attached to them or find them even a little bit relatable or likeable i just don’t care about these new movies or shows featuring these toxic characters also i just discovered your channel and i love your content ,negative
can we go back to the days where hulk was an angry green monster and not just my dad,neutral
im so happy to see the live action version of princess fiona disappointed they left out shrekbut hulk is a good compromise,positive
im infinitely better at controlling my anger than you bruce abused as a child loses women he loves including nat chased by the military his entire life and forced into hiding lives in fear of transforming and murdering innocents actually attempts suicide jennifer sometimes i get catcalled,negative
my favourite part was when shehulk said dont call me shehulk its shulk truly the most tv series of our time,positive
i miss the days were entertainment was entertaining,neutral
daredevil at the end was the icing on the cake show looks like it’s going to be awesome,positive
do your thing i really like this outfit shehulks clothes were fully intact what was the purpose of that line,positive
“evil cannot create anything new they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made”,negative
“i control my anger infinitely more than a repressed man who was abused as a child chased by military and had his entire life love and career ruined by an accident that produced a giant rage monster” well done writers,negative

esta serie probablemente no sea para todos ¡pero está bien me gusta cómo marvel está ampliando sus producciones en estilos y tonos para llegar a más cantidad de público,neutral
me sentí en los 2000s viendo una serie de disney chanel ,positive
un trailer siempre tiene que intentar verse épico para llamar la atención y que la serie prometa ser vista por muchos pero muchas veces el trailer resulta mejor que toda la serie y no termina siendo lo que uno esperaba por lo que se ve en el trailer va a ser una serie con 90 probelmas de una chica adolescente como por ejemplo problemas amorosos y 10 de cosas de súperhéroes ojalá no sea así,neutral
amo que marvel siempre en sus tráiler usan una buena música,neutral

daqui a pouco eles vão anunciar um show de stand up de thor e hulk os novos comediantes da marvel,neutral
quando thanos enfrentou o hulk em guerra infinita eu achei um absurdo total como que um personagem que é movido pelo ódio e o ódio é o sua fonte de força foi dominado e jogado ao chão sendo que até o capitão américa teve uma performance maior perante o thanos agora vendo esse trailer e entendi a marvel transformou o incrível hulk em um comédia hulk que lástima tudo isso,neutral
segue a desconstrução dos maiores e melhores heróis da marvel,neutral
as vezes fico pensando era melhor o thanos ter ganho,neutral
todos que acompanhavam o hulk em quadrinhos vão concordar comigo o gigante verde alter ego incontrolável de bruce banner que era mortal mais poderoso da terra e agora o transformaram nessa figura ridícula o incrível hulk agora só na lembrança ,neutral

unbelievable as a comic book fan i still cannot believe how far marvel has come along thank you marvel and disney,positive

im one of those fans that get excited when watching any marvel movie or series i love what disney and marvel studios have created i cant wait to watch all of these,positive
i feel so lucky to be here to witness the birth of not only a new phase but a new saga too i got into marvel during phase 4 and missed out on all of the infinity saga hype and seeing all of this for phase 5 makes me feel so so happy especially with all the joy marvel has bought me currently i am literally so ready to witness these movies and shows with others and cannot wait to see what comes in the mcu,positive

i have to say that i couldnt be more pleased to hear the daredevil is going to get a long episodic run 18 episodes is literally awesome that is probably my favorite news out of this whole slate release,positive

the fact they’ve given daredevil 18 episodes is amazing i hope they have the writing team from netflix return,positive

sem dúvida que além de bom será um filme muito emocionante pois como mostraram a imagem do chadwick não só mais um filme mas uma grande homenagem será feita nele pra esse ator que se dedicou em silêncio até o último minuto a entregar pra gente não só um excelente trabalho como também uma força de motivação de continuar lutando até o fim independente das circunstâncias sempre com um sorriso no rosto e em silêncio apenas dividindo com sua familia de verdade achei isso muito bacana ,neutral

i will say the cgi is looking a whole lot better actually made the show feel more interesting props to the teams working on it,positive
i like that bruce is trying to teach her that even though she may plan on just going back to a regular lawyer the fact that she is a hulk like him will bring challenge or trouble no matter what so the least he can do is train her to control her strength n ways where its effective n can possibly avoid the collateral damage he has always brought as a raging out of control hulk,neutral
this looks really good and im talking about the relationship dynamic between bruce and jennifer as well as the vfx the music goes well too,positive
wow that video was amazing the show looks so fun im glad they fixed the cgi so that the characters look like theyre actually enjoying themselves i saved almost 90 on my airfare purchases using mighty  travels  premium,positive
love shehulk seeing her in court should be hilarious but im itching to see how well shes going to break the 4th wall really hope she points some healthy fun at the marvel cinematic universe,positive
ok honestly the cgi on she hulk looks better than in the teaser that last shot of her saying “that’s good” looks real something she never did before,positive
she hulk comics were hands down some of the funniest comics i read as a kid decent action but mostly hilarious if this is a half as funny theyll have a winner,positive
i absolutely love the cousin rivalry these two have bruces little punk and jens teasing makes me incredibly excited for this bruce has been a comfort character of mine for a while and i cant wait to see him some more with the addition of a new hero i will say bruce seems unbelievably upbeat through everything hes been though from his childhood to the end of the infinity saga but im glad to see him less awkward and more confident in himself i understand this is about introducing jennifer to the mcu but if we dont get a little of bruces backstory perhaps provoked by jen making a remark about childhood stuff i will riot j,positive
i love that bruce is learning to cut loose and and not stuck in his stickinthemud ways anymore that trip to sakaar certainly did wonders to his selfesteem,positive

sorry i cut out they had maintenance on my power lines today but yes captain marvel has been hinted at for so long by captain america saying shes off planet to kamala with the poster its supposed to be what 5 to 10 years in the future she hasnt came back yet,neutral

esse filme da fiona em live action vai ser incrível,neutral
ahh nada melhor do que ver mais um filme com esse cgi super realista ,positive
gostava da voz do jorge lucas como dublador do hulk agora toda vez que ouço a voz nova me lembro do adam sandler ,neutral
só eu imaginei essa interação funcionário 1 poderíamos fazer um modelo 3d do zero dessa personagem e manter a personalidade destrutiva dela marvel mas isso custaria muita grana principalmente para uma série então não funcionário 2 poderíamos esticar a imagem dela e botar um filtro de cor verde algo simples sem gastar nada marvel perfect ,positive
parabens a marvel pela melhor produção de shrek 6 esperei tanto tempo para ver um liveaction desse filme,neutral
com tanto efeito verde ao mesmo tempo e com essa qualidade incrível já já aparece o dollynho com uma capa de super heroi minha série ,positive
cgi tá top demais nem dá pra perceber que é gráfico de 1998 parece que é real de tão bom que tá,neutral
the first trailer had me hyped this trailer has me ultra hyped,positive
whats it been like 3 4 years 8 years 7months and six days give or take thor never forgets,neutral
i really really loved the movie i wish it had taken a more serious turn because i agree with the villain’s perspective and it would have been amazing to see him as a more developed character however the movie was hilarious and i’ve needed a good laugh i had a really good time and i think in the end that’s what matters to me,positive
the part where thor said its thunder time and thundered patrick bateman really put me to tears truly a movie,positive
i don’t know what to say about this movie it is one of the marvel movies of all time the cgi is animated the characters are written the story is written the acting is done and overall the movie is made it is a movie it’s one of the mcu movies of all time i like the part where thor said “it’s thundering time” and then he thundered all the bad guys truly a movie,positive
christian bale as gorr looks terrifying love it,negative
definitivamente supero mis espectativas muy bueno excelente,positive
gorr was amazing just upset the quote you are not like the other gods ive killed wasnt in the movie idk in the trailer it was just smooth af,positive
this is without a doubt one of the movies of this year,positive
its like watching a whole new god of thunder it doesnt feel like watching thor because hes so serious and in this he is taken to a joke,negative
what do you think is the best kiss in a marvel movie,neutral
it doesn’t matter if you are team cap or team iron man we are all unified under our hate of the unnecessary kiss between steve and sharon,neutral
but if we’re being honest tony and pepper are the most realistic either in the kissing scence or as a relationship as a whole,neutral
dont forget wandavision it not only gave a background to their relationship but showed there was love between the two of them,positive
lets all be real aunt may and happy are the best couple,positive
wheres the kiss between quill and gamora,neutral
scott and hope are the best couple and theyre actually realistic but dangerously underrated,positive
steve and natasha am i a joke to you,neutral
vision and wanda maximoff are the best mcu couple,positive
we can all agree the romanogers kiss was the best,positive
thor el único en tener 4 películas individuales en el mcu hasta el momento,neutral
me encanta cómo después de que thor perdiera a todos lo que amaba mamá papá hermano amigos su reino el amor su cuerpo los guardianes de la galaxia han estado allí con él para ayudarlo y darle una familia,neutral
un propósito lo es todo fuiste el héroe que más perdió en su evolución gracias thor obtendrás el descanso que mereces,positive
siempre he sentido que la forma en que marvel elige a los actores ha sido perfecta quiero que chris hemsworth y benedict cumberbatch desempeñen sus respectivos roles en el mcu tanto tiempo como puedan siento que nacieron para interpretar estos papeles,neutral
tengo una mezcla de emociones estoy feliz por verlo de nuevo y triste porque cada vez son menos los vengadores originales que quedan ,neutral
esa canción le llego a lo mas profundo casi 11 años siguiendo las aventuras del dios del trueno  siento que envejecimos juntos,neutral
me encanta volver a escuchar a los guns roses en una película ahora todo el mundo va escuchar este tema en sus play playlist y celulares aguanten los guns roses y thor ,neutral
me duele porque este podría ser el final de thor claro el actor dijo que aún hará más películas pero es triste saber que su lugar como vengador lo tomara jane espero algún día regrese al equipo y luche a su lado una vez más ya sea contra galactus beyonder o en la guerra del multiverso ,neutral
y este bello universo que seguimos hace mas de 10 años sigue mas vivo que nunca  vamos carajo por mas del mcu,positive
en serio sweet child o mine le queda perfecto al avance love guns nroses  regresará ha estar de moda así como something in the way de nirvana en the batman ,positive
“only one can do both” daredevilfades from existence,neutral
jennifer actually saying lawyer show straight into the camera is exactly what i want to see in a shehulk series,positive
i will definitely watch this show it’s different and with all the chaos that ensues in the mcu it’s nice to have a change of course there will still be chaos but not like some avengers level threat…hopefully,positive
this looks amazing they clearly are making a very entertaining show cant wait to see who else the surprise characters are that shows up,positive
this is hilarious i want the show to have this exact feel to it,positive
i honestly hope that beginning part with the dun dun is actually the intro for the whole series cause thats hilarious,positive
as a law and order franchise fan i appreciate the beginning of this clip,positive
weirdly enough this is the trailer that sold me seems like an actual breath of fresh air looking at the mcu from a new angle and if that opening joke is any indication looks like a fun show im honestly excited now,positive
i died at the “dun dun” can’t wait for this show to come out,positive
super excited going to binge it when final episode comes out ,positive
this was a great stream it felt like the production quality had gone up a lot since the last marvel one and everyone played well i thought peter was a great addition to the stream he started a little quiet but really got into it,positive
love it cant wait for this box and also the wolverine pack also cant wait to see what else you guys have in store for the xmen saga,positive
we cant wait to get the box and hero packs so we can play the campaign on the channel xmen my favorite comic franchise glad to see them come to champions,positive
great stream really love seeing the passion and enjoyment you all show for the game it’s also obvious how much you understand the core of characters and continually being that across in your designs thanks and keep up the good work,positive
great stream slims cards are subtly powerful really affected the outcome,positive
love xmen hopefully they stay around a long long time this game will now be called xmen the card game as far as i’m concerned and if it’s not too late i’d love to see quentin quire aka kid omega,positive
i got to play the sabertooth scenario at gen con and we straight up got our heads kicked in,neutral
should we consider calebs comments on psychic rapport to be an official errata because as written when the phoenix player takes that action they would not be able to choose that option it would have to read something like return a cyclops card from the discard pile to the cyclops players hand,neutral
unfortunately i wasn’t able to make it live but i do have a question how do you resolve shadows of the past with phoenix it seems a waste to have this restrainedunrestrained status mechanic only to have sotp say just forget all that,negative
please make a nathan christopher summers aka cable xmen hero pack please,neutral
shrek 5 looks great,positive
she hulk “im better at controlling my anger because i control my anger infinitely more than you i control my anger when im catcalled in the street and when toxic men explain my job to me” do the writers even know bruce banner at all or do they just look at him as “a man that gets angry and turns green and big” because that line of dialogue was ridiculous bruce banner was abused as a kid watched his father figure beat his mom to death bruce tried to off himself and failed bruce has to live with the fact that hulk took control of his body and mass killed innocent people in avengers 2 absolute ridiculous writing,negative
she hulk comics were hands down some of the funniest comics i read as a kid decent action but mostly hilarious if this is half as funny theyll have a winner,positive
hulk has fought aliens monsters been sent into space been in battles taken on thanos forced into hiding had a split personality and has been hunted and attacked by the military but shehulk was sort of cat called by three guys outside a bar and her boss did some mansplaining early in the episode so her life is in her words infinitely more stressful than real hulk this show is making feminism seem more ridiculous not less also smart hulk sucks aaron american,negative
im so glad i found and watched that video i miss when movies used to make sense im expecting this series to explain why the hulk is back in his human form in shang chis end credits i saved almost 90 on my flights using mighty  travels  premium,positive
its great to see hulk jumping again,positive
love the part where she says its hulkin time truly one of the shows of the year,positive
i adore tatiana shes easily one of the best actors currently working between her brilliant performances in orphan black or in 2020s perry mason but my god this looks pretty terrible im so bummed for her because this is the first mainstream exposure shes gotten as an actor and this looks like its shaping up to be a complete trainwreck,negative
when you start telling the audience how to feel about the character see super girl e1 you have to doubt they will succeed at showing us a compelling character,negative
my favorite part was morbius is saved by shehulk in the first episode their scene celebrating in the champaign room afterward was a comedy goldmine he repays her kindness by teaching her the secret of activating full power with morbin time,positive
un crossover entre dc y marvel es prematuro sin que antes dc tenga pilares sólidos y con pilares sólidos me refiero a afianzar los personajes principales personajes y no un black adam que no es un villano ni un héroe sino todo lo contrariono es uno de ellos ni tan siquiera se parece a su contrapartida del cómic,neutral
todavía es muy pronto para un crossover de dc vs marvel tranquiiiiiloooo dwayne no tan rápido es cierto que a muchos fans frikis nos encantaría este crossover pero para mí es pronto primero que hagan muchas pelis de dc tantas como más o menos marvel y luego ya veremos si se podría hacer ese crossover el día que llegue ese crossover si es que lo hacen la vamos a flipar seguro,neutral
la gente parece pensar que daredevil siempre es como en la etapa de frank miller que por cierto también tuvo momentos de humor cuando tiene otras etapas en las que se permite ser menos serio,neutral
actualmente la unica manera que marvel haga pelis con dc es que las produzca marvel y se queden con el 80 de las ganancias de la peli,neutral
pues estaría mejor que the rock haga un wwe vs aew ahora con esta nueva era de triple h estaría súper epico,neutral
me meo con el momento “jessica gao”… eres el mejor tío ,positive
yo pensaba que the rock nunca saldría en un crossover de dc porque perdería el protagonismo que el suele tener pero resulta que le gustaría un dc vs marvel lo que quiere decir que si se puede contar con el para un proyecto mas grande sería un cañón verlo haciendo parte de la legión del mal,neutral
si hay una película marvel vs dc me gustaría que fuese animada,neutral
según yo lo veo en eternals marvel fue la primera en guiñarle un ojo a dc para alguna probable película conjunta el problema que yo veo es que evidentemente ambas compañías querrán un 50 de participación y beneficios en todo y el mundo compartido de dc ni por asomo esta lo suficientemente consolidado como para que le dé a dc la necesaria fuerza de negociación para el proyecto,neutral
el primer máquina de guerra o el primer actor que interpretó a superboy en la serie de los 80,neutral
imagine if thats really the grandmasters ship and all of this leads to the debut of world war hulk in the mcu that would be insane,neutral
the cosmos determined her fate for calling steve rogers out like that ,neutral
captain america turns chair around and sits down so…you made fun of me and suffered the consequences,negative
in the movie that came out in the 70’s he was in a car crash with his wife or girlfriend i believe he was able to get himself out but he couldn’t get her out which lead him on a mission to find the chemical that makes people strong in situations like that,neutral
honestly i was expecting one of the tires to burst and we’d get the car crash that occurred at the beginning of the pilot to the original incredible hulk tv series,neutral
seeing those flamin hot cheetos go to waste was such a heart wrenching moment for me,negative
“obviously captain america was a virgin” she hulks final words,neutral
this right here is propably the most important thing to make a show or movie like that really work on an emotional level it grounds even the most fantastic characters and stories in a way no amount of vfx can casual smalltalk that actually feels like smalltalk with all the natural imperfections she even slightly misspoke like we all do from time to time 010 and they left that in that takes courage but it makes even this short clip so much better i respect that a lot and i am really looking forward to this show,positive
“oh ok so this must be some jerkwad driving like in doctor strange“ spaceship “what the hell” oo,negative
ok that got me i was not expecting that i thought it would be some kind of a regular car accident but this is the mcu i guess,negative
podrán decir lo que quieran de que está película será pura comedia como thor ragnarok pero de lo que no hay duda que gorr será un villanazo definitivamente taika waititi hizo que hela fuera una muy buena villana en el ragnarok y aquí no será la excepción,neutral

its heartbreaking how sad strange is when he says everyone who knows and loves you we we will have no memory of you,negative
the snap was awesome but finally getting to hear avengers assemble was off the chart it brought home all of the years of wait for an epic payoff thats my own number one,positive
avengers endgame itself is speechless,negative
i’d say half the universe was speechless after infinity war ,neutral
the last 45 minutes of endgame was so epic but totally agree with cap wielding mjolnir it was so sad to see peter not reminding mj who he is just to keep her n ned safe and for him to be literally all alone to see everyone vanish after the snap especially peter was jaw dropping,neutral
“we can handle your little witch” proceeds to get destroyed with ease,negative
when captain america was facing down thanos his entire army when all hope was lost on your left almost every hero from the mcu showed up for the final battle,neutral
im surprised quantumania doesnt have a single set here may be something that comes later due to the bump up but no doubt morbius is the standout,neutral
i personally love the marvel mech line and i think rocket raccoon will make for a super fun looking one ,positive
this set with morbius is gonna to be one of the lego sets ever made,positive
my favorite part is when just2good stepped on a lego morbius set and said its reviewing time,positive
i like that lego is finally making morbius as he already had a brief appearance in the daily bugle also the rocket mech set could be groot and rocket together but well have to wait to see,positive
no but i’m genuinely hyped for the morbius set  glad it’ll be cheap too,positive
if you asked me if a morbius set would sell out before the movie was announced i would say no i’m excited we’re getting him though want him to be in a set with spidey and blade,positive
i get people are meming about morbius but he is unironcally a really interesting character and i love to see how they will design his minifig design,positive
no way im in complete disbelief there is a morbius set even if it is most likely comic book based thats awesome,positive
i hope its a modified version of the endgame quinjet so that way we will get the the heroes who werent in last years infinity saga in their endgame suits example black widow hawkeye roedey and maybe a more accurate version of rescue but in blue not purple,neutral
cant believe this year kass will have a bump and next year a new addition ,positive

i think it would be kinda cool if like everyone had their own colour and dressed up in only their colour or you guys could do something related to the new movie zombies 3,positive
i think that some great halloween costumes for big family’s could be greece the movie star wars toy story different prisoners people from the 50s ghost busters movieboygirl or sea creatures,positive
you guys should dress up like your from the 80’s or 90’s vintage  or you can be models and you won’t have to dress up at all ,neutral

the amount of planning really deserves appreciation being a marvel fan it gives me so much happiness after seeing the avengers titles but dont get me wrong the benchmark the marvel set with infinity war and endgame really seems unmatchable,positive

i was impressed by how more often than not that it actually felt like people interacting onscreen and not cgi hulk animations the montageaction in most cgi scenes i feel use so much motion blur that theyre justwellblurry there was a bit of that here but overall its becoming more naturalistic dig it eyes flicker and the uncanny valley is usually from the need to add every frame between the movements for smoothness when there isnt much smoothness at all to eye movement they did a good job with the eyes for sure this has nothing to to with much of what was covered in the video but just throwing in 2 cents,positive
she actually uses her audiencedirected powers at the very beginning of the show for the first time imo when she’s about to leave for her trial and then turns around and says to the audience that “we probably want to know about all the hulk stuff first so you’ll actually be interested in the lawyer part of the show” or something along those lines,neutral

5 free movies on youtube availability subject to change 5 hackers 4 idiocracy 3 2 the silence of the lambs 1 the truman show 5 free hidden gems on youtube 5 sidekicks 4 penelope 3 troll 2 2 milius 1 primer paid already free low quality version of primer primer was removed as free just after this video was complete and uploaded it is available to rent most places you rent movies if you find the low quality version linked above to be unwatchable apologies but as i said youtube will add and remove their free movies chaotically here is the full list of free youtube movies get your universal yums box,neutral
you hit a soft spot with ronin i think that movie is a masterpiece that went largely unnoticed the acting the dense subtext the camera angles the story progresses while revealing nothing awesome,positive
penelope is actually a really great movie my roommate and i love this movie and have watched it many many times if you havent seen it you should and i have to say its a great movie for school age kids to watch because it will teach them a lot of lessons against bullying others or if youre child is the one being bullied then they will learn a lot about how to love themselves no matter what they look like and for those parents who criticize your children a lot you can learn a lot about accepting your child for who they are regardless of how you had envisioned your child to be theres a lot to learn from people of all ages watch it,positive
great recommendations list darren ronin and the car chases awesome and has a great plot silence of the lambs just a superb horror agree that anthony hopkins is on his finest day with his portrayal of hannibal lecter just received my latest universal yums from czech republic today 9232021 many thanks for sharing with us and catch you on your next presentation take care ,positive
these movie reviews are always good and largely because they are honest if a given film is admittedly not the greatest or otherwise flawed the reviewer still tries to point out what might be good or desirable about the movie etc its a very democratic approach always a good job,positive
i recently watched hackers again and realized that its a really good pairing with the original tron they both present ridiculous representations of how computers work but they are complementary just from opposite sides of the screen great performances from a great cast in both cases they are solid presentations of how people wished computers worked in the late twentieth century immediately before and after al gore opened up the internet to everyone,positive
one thing that makes or breaks a film is how the filmmaker respects the source material in this case being the silence of the lambs by thomas harris the film respected and captured this incredible book the casting of jodi foster and anthony hopkins with jonathan demme directing made it a masterpiece some movies you sit and watch others creat a dimensional world you enter completely and that never really leaves you,positive
while i generally agree with your comments about ronin the callous disregard of collateral damage shooting into crowds and causing violent vehicle accidents was a total turnoff for me they spread injury and death among innocent bystanders without any sign of care or compassion,negative
i just watched post mortem on netflix last night and really liked it its from norway and has only six episodes in the series im not sure how i could describe it horror a little comedy a bit police procedural i guesssome it was just really strange and at least to me very entertaining also i watch all foreign movies with subtitles so i dont know if its dubbed or not anyway check it out,positive
im sure youve seen malevolent from 2018 with florence pogue but if you havent its just a really well acted horror flick i seem to like just about everything florence pogue is in thanks for another great list as i plan to check out primer and troll 2 both of which i never would have considered without your recommendation pls keep making as many of these lists as you can,positive

thank you so much alison for sharing with us another of your wonderful recipes even if they are as classic as a chicken piccata i really appreciate the personal twists that you give to them your twists bring the dishes to a next level i am very sorry for the abuses microaggressions that you had to endure in your profession i had no idea what the word chef said it in that context meant but i know from my own experience how even simple wordsstatements can actually be aggressions towards other people i have felt that many times in my profession too which has nothing to do with cooking btw lucky us that despite those unfortunate abuses they did not make you dislike cooking and quit altogether on the contrary you persevered in your chosen path and now you are sharing your uniqueness and talent with us thanks again never look at yourself through the eyes of the joyless,positive

the magnificent seven over time has come to describe the lead actors more than the movie and the most magnificent of the seven yul brynner impossible to match him,positive
possibly not only the greatest film ever made but the greatest story the lesson being that material possession should never take prescendence over our common humanity a dollar bill always looks as big as a bedspread what a line,positive
yul brynner steve mcqueen charles bronson james coburn robert vaughn and elly wallace one can only imagine what the production took to create such a classic all of these professionals were real actors that worked for a craft and then defined their craft particularly according to each ones caliber of understanding timeless is correct,neutral
i saw this movie in seventies as a teenager several times they were all so larger than life heroes there can never be another magnificent seven,positive
even though the movie is a remake its one of all time greats sure some plot twists are naive and the fightingeffects dont stand to contemporary cinematography but everything else is simply brilliant starting with the original score all the way to the moral lessons the movie brings a true inspiring masterpiece,positive
i first watched this movie in a cinema in 1960s the righteousness truthfulness bravery and courage shown in the characters in the movie helped to mold my character in the later days of my youth and made me join the uniformed service to serve the public,positive

i completely agree with you about thirteen lives i watched it the other night and i wasnt sure i was going to make it to the end it was so intense and i felt so claustrophobic and almost panicky at times watching it unbelievably fantastic movie,positive
better luck tomorrow is still one of my all time favorite films as an asianamerican i never understood the criticism that this film made us look bad that viewpoint was actually way worse and even racist in my opinion what we can only have roles as nerds straight a students martial artists dutiful sons and daughters etc this film portrayed more of my reality at that age than any other film ever did sure i wasnt dealing and stealing and whatnot i was in all advanced classes and band but i also ran track and played volleyball and had a cheerleader girlfriend and went to parties i felt seen by this film i may not have always agreed with ebert but i will always respect him for using his influence and voice in the industry to shoot down that nonsense at the time,neutral
i wish someone would come up with a streaming service that includes a lot of movies from the 40s and 50s without having to pay extra for them im a big fan of classics including the likes of cary grant kate hepburn william powell etc i used to be able to watch them on youtube but theyve pretty much all been pulled because of copyright infringement,negative
thirteen lives was incredible its exactly how we as human should be behaving,positive
i really liked bound it shows even if you have a small budget you can still make a really good movie 13 lives was good also i watched marathon man when i was too young to get into it or understand it i recently watched it on prime,positive
you could not have been more spot on with thirteen lives darren what an amazing film incredible thank you as always for the recommendations,positive
i always appreciate the work you put into your reviews i feel that you’re very thorough and honest in your opinion thank you for what you do jcvd is an amazing movie very hidden gem,positive
another killer list ive said it before but check out birdy for one of nicolas cages earliest movies and hector and the search for happiness both are terrific movies,positive
13 lives was an excellent movie i remember hearing the situation on the news i didnt realize how long those kids were trapped and what had to be done to get them out drowning suffocating is a fear of mine so seeing this had me on the edge of my seat anxious as fuck but it was worth it i highly recommend this movie it was so so good great even,positive
i have watched vikram vedha on youtube in hindi last year i dont think saif can beat r madhwan in acting r madhwan surprised us in the end as he looks innocent throughout the whole movie but saif doesnt look innocent at all throughout the trailer r madhwans smile was enough to make vikram vedha a thriller movie,positive
vijay sethupathi is one of the most talented actor i have seen in south industry n r madhavan is one of the most underrated actor love the original masterpiece,positive
krk reviews should be released in theatres all reviews one after another for 3 hours it will become blockbuster ,positive
sad to see that in the name of entertainment we are spending so much on theater tickets that these actors are demanding 25 crores for a movie even highly educated proffesionals cas engineers doctors civil servants etc do not earn this kind of money in india after 10 year of service a simple logic if theses actors including the kumars khans devgans kapoors roshans etc start charging 10 to 50 lac per movie the theater ticket price will drop automatically and eventually we can start enjoying movie in the theaters with our families at a much lesser price these superstars have built their mansions worth 100 crores and secured the lifes of their children and grandchildren they are living kingsize life with our hard earned money i believe we better stick to ott or any other form of free entertainment which is easily available on youtube or any other app,negative
i always wonder why his videos are never in trending they are so hilarious yet to the point,positive
everyone is busy praising this moviebut i prefer the original anytimeno comparison therebut your reviews are as usual hilarious,positive
not willing to watch others review always waiting for legend mr krk,neutral
hey krk you are someone who is an well educated well sensed human who is trying to destroy the good works for his own personal interest everyone can agree that the recent vikram vedha teaser is really well stucked piece of art yeah its a remake but why it has made because the original one was not popular at all and it holds a great contents so why not it should be showcased second time hrithik roshan is someone who thrives himself towards great art work so guys dont take seriously these kind of nonsense review by a nonsense person like krk ,neutral
313 hilarious review  i am pakistani and i always wait for krk videos by god big fan krk bro i watch your videos everyday because you always made my day with your incredible review also id say krks viewer doing unfair with him because he deserves like similar to views everyone must like his videos because he is doing hard working for us and he always keep us updated about bollywood activities and news so he deserves for views like and followers love from lahore pakistan,positive

a small detail from that kelly’s hero’s scene is when the tiger tank traverses the turret the engine could be heard revving the tiger turret was was hydraulic operated which was powered by a mechanical drive from the engine increasing the engine rpm would allow for hydraulic pump to increase speed allowing the turret to traverse quicker,neutral

unexpected chieftain is the best chieftain great guy great channel great knowledge so glad to see him on this episode,positive
this was immensely enjoyable we need more with loremaster moran,positive
the main problem with the tiger scene in fury is that decision making although independent thinking was encouraged in the german army the choice here to take the tiger out of cover and engage on the move is a miserable decision on the commanders behalf the tiger had no gyroscopic turret so would be very inaccurate whilst moving he also has the ability to kill all of those shermans through their front armour at that range and can’t even be sure they know his exact position essentially the commander is a tool,negative

it’s not so much the fact that they don’t know these movies that makes me mad it’s the disrespect they are showing towards the animation that gets me mad people worked hard to draw those films hand drawn animation and cell animation was tough compared to now with computer drawn animation and a lot of the animation on these movies still hold up,negative

great video as an established data scientist myself this is definitely an accurate data science project lifecycle however i almost never go through all of these steps in the same day you can spend whole days just cleaning data tuning models or putting things into production the work that you do can also vary by company some data scientists only work on part of that lifecycle just doing exploration and modeling or modeling and productionization i have a few videos on my channel that complement this one nicely for those interested,positive
it was a great overview of all the process it would be great if we get more videos on data preparation eda various methods for different scenarios,positive
great video you did great explaining this that said i would argue that it can never be overstated how extremely rigorous you must be in the earliest steps specifically data acquisition and cleaning mistakes in these steps will often corrupt every subsequent step in your research furthermore it is these earliest steps that are the hardest if not impossible to correct if mistakes are found do some field work say nsf or an ffrdc gives you 2 million dollars for it go out into the field and unknowingly bring the wrong brand of batteries for your solar panels that you don’t figure out until your back oh well this seemingly tiny and innocent mistake turns a long lived project of monitoring an area into a very short lived one when the battery dies all the clocks on your instruments are not correctly synced by gps and you have timing errors now now we have absolutely horrible data that needs to be cleaned the first two steps acquisition and cleaning are so important,positive

hi max very informative and interesting question at 1316 you talk about continuous data and contrast every number from infinity to infinity ie numerical infinity with every number between 0 and 1 however can those numbers be equally infinite as subdivisions can be infinite,positive
thank you so much for this im going to college in the fall to major in public health and i was thinking of picking up a data science minor as well this is simple enough for me to understand what the field is what it requires,positive
thanks for all the great work you folks do,positive
do you still want to be a data scientist ,neutral
i only wanted to become a data scientist so i could buy fancy cat pots to put my plants in,neutral
we need to spend less time asking people what they want to be and more time asking them what problems they want to solve what they want to build or what kind of value they would like to create,neutral
damn a data scientist is just someone who is really good at a lot of hard things,positive
ive considered data science but for me itll come down to who wants to use the data and how a lot of businesses want to use data science to increase profits but im more interested in using data to discover things help people etc,positive
instead of dealing with the discomfort of whether i made the right decision i decided to do a data science phd so i have peace of mind knowing i made the wrong decision,neutral
as someone who transferred from data science to data analysis i agree with every point here being in the everlasting learning process was particularly exhausting not that data analysis needs no learning but the intensity ds requires is of another level,negative
ive been considering taking a master degree in data science and business analytics and i was wondering whats like being a data scientist until i found your video thanks youtube and thanks tina i have more idea now,positive
i am not totally sure about whether or not i want to be a data scientist the interest towards learning has been kind of gradual for me but for now i can say that my inclination is more on the side of data cleaning data modelling and data visualisation i might probably end up somewhere close to being a data analyst cant imagine beyond that for now checked for all points that you mentioned bang on except for the last one marketing ones own work i am someone who believes strongly in my work speaking for myself rather than otherwise have been trying hard to change this mindset of mine might take a while but will get to it definitely thanks for this informative one helped me clear my mind about certain things see you on the next livestream,neutral
this got me so excited to be a data scientist always learning in different fields and getting to continue being a scientist it sounds great,positive
the video we have been waiting on from tina ,positive
1 learn the fundamentals of maths 2 basic knowledge of computers 21 learn the basics of a programming language eg r or python 3 the most important thing learn statistics its by far the biggest part of data science machine learning is 80 statistics 4 build little projects and try to connect something with a database 5 dont be overhelmed of all that new technology stuff nobobdy knows everything and you dont need everything too,positive
im in cyber security doing vulnerability management but this is making me want to get deeper into data science i wish youtube had more entertaining and enthusiastic creators like tina ken luke in the cybersecurity field,positive
those are valuable pieces of advice i always get caught going deep but my main problem is distraction i end up learning too many things,negative
this is was far more comprehensive than i expected so many other channels will throw up python and sql and will then recommend a bootcamp or moocs solid video and thank you very much,positive
very well thought i agree with everything that has been said in the video i used the breadthfirst approach when i changed my career to software engineering couple years ago and yes its least painful and most effective way to learn skills for a technical industries thanks for the video im just starting with data science and this is very helpful not that you only say what to learn but also how and where  ,positive
this was really insightful and helpful thanks for making this,positive
i’m currently an entry level community manager data science is so intriguing to me as it would allow me to listen to userbases and other communities so much more closely you just gave me what i need to get started learning thank you,positive
i found this video to be very well done when i begin work on a new model i always start with a google search and go from there unfortunately you cant do this during an interview i feel like some of the best people on planet earth get overlooked all the time just because employers expect people to start with a blank piece of paper and build out a model ive been in the data science world for the past 10 years and thats 10 years of proven success if thats not good enough for you writing code on a blank sheet of paper wont help very much at all,positive
this is very helpful thanks for putting this together,positive
the biggest problem i’ve had so far is working with my manager we both have very different perspectives on various problems but he simply doesn’t even want to hear my perspective even when my perspective is usually right we are both data scientists but he graduated as a data scientist back in 2003 so he’s an old head and i recently graduated it’s very tough to get along and having your voice heard,negative
im learning data science and whenever i read job descriptions for entry levels or even for interns they want you to be jack of all trades and on top of that require you to have 23 years of experience plus they include big data streamlines and ask you to be an expert on it too along with all sorts of cloud services i mean it feels like theyre demanding an intermediate data scientist and terming it as data analysis intern or junior data analyst role this frustrates me a lot,negative
yes there’s ambiguity in role definitions in my previous company i worked as data scientist however i hardly did any data science work it was more like a developer work where i was assigned to test and deploy the ml models in production i could learn a lot about aws cloud architecture and services trouble shoot real time issues but did little of ml then i changed my job and joined as data analyst here i do little of analysis sql etc and more of ml like developing models and fine tuning them cleaning the data feature engineering and feature selection i would caution the people aspiring to enter the field because many a times companies themselves are not sure where and how they are going to use data science what are the prerequisites for a successful data science project they lack quality data if they do have data accessing and compiling the data is another issue after aligning with multiple departments as single man army you are expected to give some magical results when results are satisfactory you will be asked to deploy them here again the streamlined organisational requirements are missing somehow you drag the project later you are expected to monitor and troubleshoot issues in production and then after all of this single man army efforts management doesn’t see any value in it just to keep up with trend companies end up hiring a data scientist and expect that person to assume multiple roles and give them an end to end solution they are just giving analytics a try without investing much in it,neutral
i feel like tech jobs always morph we have hiring expansions and more specialities then we have layoffs and more generalizations it does seem like the demand for data scientists dropped off a cliff but i’ve been studying it a bit as a way to complement other skills thanks for the video ,positive
great insight i got into data science right after college and really struggled to do so the fact that the data science job role is defined so differently at different companies made interviews really hard to prep for it felt like you need to be a jack of all trades and be well versed in data science data engineering and data analyst principles and it was just a lot to prep for plus a lot of roles require graduate degrees after i got a role i left after a year and transitioned into swe as like you said the expectations didn’t match the reality plus i was also at a toxic workplace i realized that i want to be in a role that is more welldefined and somewhat uniform across companies so if i need to look for a job later i’m not being restricted to only a subset of opportunities bc of the different definitions and requirements,neutral
thanks for sharing your experiences the manager who spoke of wanted applied scientists a category i wasnt aware of before this video was odd to me so he was saying that there wasnt enough data science related work for a full time hire or else he wouldnt be wanting someone who could also serve as a software engineer i can imagine companies having this need smaller companies in particular where individuals have to wear multiple hats but if i were a data scientist trying to get hired as a data scientist id avoid this managercompany i actually left a job in the 90s for this reasoni was being pulled into other jobstasks that werent related to machine learning so i left and joined a company i could do machine learning full time im an old guy i predated data science so in that time it was called data mining or pattern recognition and yes im using machine learning and data science interchangeably even though i know they arent fully interchangeable the manager is keyeven if you like the company if you dont respect or are respected by your manager it will be an awful job remember that when you are being interviewed you are also interviewing them,neutral
you covered some really great points that im also experiencing in my current role as a data scientist tbh i dont even know what im supposed to be doing and it makes me feel so lost especially since im still early in my career i saw 2 great people leave the team to work as a data engineer and a software engineer its absolutely demotivating to see people leave im also looking into transitioning into a more data engineer andor product analytics role but the interview prep is super overwhelmingdifficult and imposter syndrome really kicks in ,neutral
its really difficult to work as a data scientist because every company have different expections from data scientist and now a days a data scientist should know all the skills like computer vision deep learning operational research machine learning sql and many more there must a discrete line between data scientist work roles and also as you have mentioned interview prep it is really difficult because we need to prep from scratch — struggle of a datascientist,negative
preparing for interviews can be arduous because like you pointed out that different organisations have different definitions of a data scientist role and data science is such an extremely broad term that is often times disputed amongst people you only find out when you sit for the interviews that the organisations sometimes are actually looking for a data analyst or ml engineer or data engineer when the interview doesnt circle around what youd imagine it to be but thats the reality and thanks for pointing it out and most of the time i am just scraping and cleaning the data which definitely gives me mixed feelings about my job role i could really relate to your experiences and it definitely resonated with me such an insightful video for the ones who want to pursue their career in data science because often times it can be misinterpreted,neutral
in my personal experience the harsh reality also included 1 studying all the time to the point that you personal life gets affected 8 hours of work and 4 hours a day of just keep up with the new lake cloud software technique library bi tool etc 2 the feeling of you dont know enough you are not enough you briefly mention this and i am glad that i am not the only feeling the same way i know python enough to do my job but i am not a python expert who can write functions from scratch or change between languages say from python to java or r i use the existing libraries and move on to the next project,neutral

great video shane completely nailed it as a data scientist myself i was a little surprised at how high the job satisfaction scores were on the job a lot of my peers find that they arent challenged enough by their positions this is probably because data science is still relatively new and companies are still figuring out how to create value with data teams the other side of that is that once you have a data science role it is pretty easy to land another data science job so qualified data scientists can just leave if they arent liking the position at hand i love seeing the data and trying to map it to what im hearing anecdotally,positive
i loved the remark about how ifwhen data scientists jobs get automated either the world would have ended or world peace would have been achieved ,positive
excellent datadriven assessment of this field i am 57 with a bs in math just retired not really want to work in data science and pursuing a masters in statistics i have one class in machine learning where neither the professor nor students are over thirty most of the students are early twenties and some might still be in their teens i was able to start on zoom but now that we are back in the class my status is very clear although i keep fit and positive i never lied about my age that would be creepy but didnt need to advertise it either so long as i pulled my weight in study groups i feel so out of place but just shake it off and try to keep on moving forward as best i can you mentioned ageism and while i have not attempted to apply for any jobs yet i have experienced ageism and how ones value can diminish at a job the brutality of it can be very harsh on the receiving end and wonder why people do not realize they will be there sooner than they might care and wonder if they consider the world they are creating me ill keep on going until i cannot i enjoy turning data into knowledge i am sure your analytics show your main demographic are on the younger end but wonder if you will address ageism in later videos either way keep the data and its interpretation flowing and rage rage against the dying of the light,positive
i’m a data analyst i will say you need to be good at attention to detail and actually know your skill set one wrong variable can skew your results majorly which can cost time and money i’ve had to bite the bullet before and it hurts wasting hours of your life on something that needs to be redone or straight abandoned,negative
thanks for the great content shane as a data scientist myself who came into this field via the shortcut route essentially given that my own engineering field had few jobs available one thing i have noticed is that it is often more useful to a data scientist and their company if the data scientist comes from the shortcut route if you come in with the domain knowledge of one engineering discipline or some other discipline plus the skills you need as a data scientist you can carve for yourself much more important roles within an organization and offer insights that traditional data science program graduates cannot while traditional education pathways into data science offers a clear cut set of classes to take it rarely allows us to draw the connection to real world data science in depth you end up being able to do what the shortcut data scientists can do but without the specialized domain knowledge coming from an engineering discipline myself i was able to understand data science problems with product perspective and help deliver projects in novel ways i have noticed the same with my other peers who also dont come from the traditional route i say this because i have met with a lot of nontraditional route students who want to do data science but feel a little scared or worried that they cant break through they definitely can break through and thrive in this field they offer specialized insights you cant get through the traditional route so if you are someone who is studying even something in the humanities like linguistics or english you can become a powerful data scientist with perhaps a specialization related to what you studied such as nlp if you are someone who comes from a stem field even better because you will already likely have most of the mathematical foundations needed to approach most data science problems all data scientists are expected to be able to do the basics of data science but what sets apart good data scientists from great data scientists is the ability to properly contextualize a business problem address user needs and help in the development of a product in a way that is meaningful beyond just a typical model i dont mean to say students who do the traditional route are by any means necessarily worse off but i do think they should also invest in acquiring knowledge in some other domains as well,positive
my close friend got his bachelors in electrical engineering then went for his masters in data science he is now making 245k including bonuses at intuit as a machine learning engineer and he’s only 26 with no experience got the interview thanks to his masters then barely passed the interview by doing over 200 leetcode questions 3x each,neutral
great video im a data analyst and just accepted an offer for data scientist position so i have some ideas on the markets for both jobs in my opinion the window for people with no previous data experience and no degree in an analytical subject getting a job as a data scientist has almost completely closed those folks oftentimes wont even get past the hr screener theres so many new data science and analytics masters programs that have opened up along with the wide variety of analytical degrees that are acceptable statistics computer science economics physics etc that someone without an analytical degree and without any job experience as a data analyst or other data professional is just never going to get an interview even if you have a great portfolio the hr screen is not even going to look at it however if you have experience as a data analyst and pick up one of these new data science or analytics masters degrees the job market becomes super easy,positive
hi shane the actuary here who has commented on your channel frequently i would just like to point out that actuary is a special case of data scientist the skill sets are extremely similar and also there are many data scientists who are hired by insurance companies i havent finished watching your video yet but i already know this is a really good one whether in or out of insurance,positive
shane i would highly recommend looking into sub reddit information i looked into data science and when you go to the data science subreddit you will see how it is nearly impossible to get a job in data science usually people will go into something like business analyst to data analyst to data scientist as a means of going up the scale also these subreddits will help you get a better idea of the requirements of different jobs for instance in it career questions even though it may be a fantastic career eventually the vast majority of entry level starts at helpdesk with a salary of 1520 an hour and is there for a few years before being able to make something like sys admin,positive
thanks alex for all the advice i finally landed a job as a data analyst at a tech startup if anyones interested i made 143 applications had 7 interviews and got 3 offers the process from starting the google course to landing a job took just under 3 months i was unemployed and working on this full time hope that helps anyone whos looking for their next job,positive

hello from italy alex as a data scientist i can say that we are more focused on deployng new models into a business process that drives direct value so the project management and the engeneering skills become really important unix professional coding sql git spark concept of testing and so on because you have to ensure that the pipeline works in every situation even when you have really bad or poor annotated data i dont think that you need a phd cause the algorithm that you use are pretty popular in the community xgboost bert resnet and so on,positive
great content as usual i dont know whether you already did a video about it but do you think that data analysis is going to be saturated in the next years with all these hype about data i was wondering if the offer of data analysis is going to be higher than the demand for these jobs thank you for spreading the knowledge about data,positive

i’ve been waiting all year for this  solid advice ken,positive
great advice on typing out other peoples work myself as a beginner its easy to get flustered on projects as some solutionstools i have not yet been exposed to by looking up others solutionswork and typing them out it really helps me to understand the anatomy of the code furthermore sometimes the solutions dont work as i am using python 310 and so i have to work out and start fishing around for the latest iteration of the modulecode and that actually helps to drive home the knowledge,positive
this video is extremely accurate i have had such a hard time learning how to be a data scientist i am in a ms in data analytics program and feel that doesnt really provide any real direction i dont know what i dont know and that keeps me from learning what i need to know seeing the path helps thank you i would like to say i have struggled to learn r and i seem to be getting sql quickly and i think this will help my confidence getting one language down can help to learn another just from a confidence standpoint,neutral

i agree that the fears of full automation and a fully saturated job market are overblown but at the same time i think theres a real pair of twin concerns that people considering advanced education should be concerned about democratization and the experience catch 22 i feel like your video alluded to what i mean by democratization quite well so i think were probably in agreement there a lot of programs focus on training people to understand the ins and outs of libraries like tensorflow pytorch and sklearn as well as how to mathematically derive and formally describe a bunch of models i think a lot of the implementation of those models is routine and boilerplate enough that its ripe for automation using some kind of automl the sqllike syntax that redshift and bigquery offer or some managed product that abstracts the implementation away this opens ml models up to the techsavy but nonspecialist employees who have a very firm grasp on the domain knowledge already pushing the roles that require deep technical expertise farther out to data engineering and mlops we still need people to hyperoptimize models and do core research for critical applications but often its just not business critical to hire full teams to read papers and install cutting edge deep learning models off of github all day for experience i really think theres a cruel pattern emerging of people investing enormous amounts of time and money toward masters programs and endless selfteaching motivated by the perception that the industry is starved for people this is where i think we disagree the job opening numbers you present are accurate but you dont talk about how that need is distributed with respect to years of experience the largest companies have well structured well funded teams that can afford to take on new grads that need training but a lot of companies are only interested if you have a proven track record and can convince them you can deliver value extremely quickly with little need for them to train or invest in you i would love to see a graph overlaying the number of candidates at each experience level over the number of jobs searching for people at that level my expectation is that youd see a massive gap favoring employers at 02 years of experience and a massive gap favoring employees at 5 years of experience so while the industry is expanding the companies arent hiring juniors or at least not at the rate you need to be optimistic coming out of an expensive not top tier masters program together i think these trends speak to a frightening future for the opportunities for new data science professionals if workers with domain experience but not a ds education can be hired directly into the junior roles given the democratization of the field and if education alone is insufficient to get you an entry level job i think were going to see a very desperate job market for people trying to get into the industry perhaps what will happen is that new grads will need to pick an industry and work a non data science job for long enough to gain years of domain experience but that can be a hard sell after spending enormous amounts of time and money on a new degree,positive
personally i think you hit one key point the importance of domain experts with the socalled automation or new technology tools well likely see a shift to empower the domain experts and focus more on the business needs just because someones knows sql or do coding doesnt mean heshe can do data science or machine learning or more importantly to put out anything meaningful or even useful just like years ago people needed to rely heavily on someone who can do graphic design really well or who can use a handful of highskill tools say photoshop really well to even modify a picture or video these days even kids can snap a picture or video and publish to instagram or tiktok did the modern photo editing tools make graphic designer extinct no but it does mean that you need to be really good to be able to survive as a graphic designer i see the same future for data science field too maybe not tomorrow but the trend is coming for sure if you pay attention to some of the podcasts like me myself and ai most the guests chief data scientists or boss of ds departments arent really of these backgrounds but more business driven,neutral
the automation part was a matter of time since a lot of the work with the data is repetitive the understanding of the business and its needs have always been the most important part of data science,neutral
working as a phd in a business school we often get hookups with companies about some data and it always shocks me how little they know id say they are very good at collecting data but they often have no idea how to use it that is if there problem is anything but a straight forward prediction problem my understanding are the best skills to have are 1 be able to identify problems 2 be able to decide how to solve the problem once that is done usually the process is just data cleaning and then running the libraries you decided on already which is fairly trivial though potentially data cleaning is time consuming but honestly dont trust me i had to go do a phd because nobody would hire me to do even the most basic stuff,negative
thats the point for example i work as bi analyst normally with power bi sql and lowcode platform powerapps automate i have a master in data science and i know how to built neural networks from scratch butfor what built a single linear regression model requieres a lot of steps and technologies azure python cloud apis devopsa lot of investment and maintenance instead most of the tools which i work on have integrated machine learning tools as image recognition nlp classification with a few steps and a clear suscription in fact i get my job because they demand for a person who knows analytics and have data science knwoladge so that can advice on the use of these integrated tools no more import keras modelfit you will be requiered to matinenance and advice about machine learnings integrated tools,neutral
prospective data scientists should focus on projects that demonstrate the ability to understand business context this this is very important,positive
asking if data science is dying would be like asking if engineering or medicine is dying there will always be a huge demand for these sorts of careers tons of people thinking they want to do them is a byproduct of that but just like engineering and medicine most people who think they want to be in the field cant really hack it for whatever reason if you are someone who is smart and hard working you dont have to worry about the field being saturated most of that saturation is from people who arent very good or who call themselves data scientists because they completed a mooc or two theres a huge difference between completing certs and degrees and being able to actually do things in the real world the wheat gets separated from the chaff pretty quickly,neutral
the whole data science industry is booming from analyst to engineers to scientist and you will see domain experts leading this field more and more,positive
what a beautiful and insightful explanation of the dynamics of data science it is true that data science demand is growing exponentially and what aspiring data scientists are fearful is lack of knowledgeable that ds is actually evolving and diverse it is become more field specific and one need to master the area of expertise like health business banking etc in respect to the application of ds in it thanks a lot thu vu for your resourceful info,positive
data science is extremely saturated at entry level just ask anybody whos applied for a data science job in the last year moreover data analyst is being rebranded as data scientist because many businesses are realizing they never needed fancy deep learning or advanced statistical models to gain insight into their data but good ole basic analysis achieved the same end at a fraction of the cost if you actually want to work on ai projects these days and not just be a data analyst youll need a phd in computer science also despite having a higher barrier to entry the outlook for data science jobs is worse than that of software engineering because the demand is a lot less compared to software engineering as data science tools continue to be democratized and automated software engineers with basic stats skills will be favored for data roles due to their better coding skills as well as the fact that the job is just an analyst role so no longer requires advanced stats knowledge for the most part,neutral
this video was soooo informative and encouraging i’m a neuroscience major looking to enter data science after college and have been trying to focus my skills in learning r data visualization and statistical analysis class of ‘23,positive
not you being a literal life saver im graduating early and i had no clue what i could do with my applied mathematics degree without going to grad school and the way you describe this the constant learning the work environment honestly makes this sound like the job for me thank you,positive
i so needed this video today i just finished my masters in data analytics and as someone who has always despised job hunting i was getting disenfranchised but you have put the fire back in my belly all of the great things you said about the career are all the reasons i started the masters so thank you for reminding me,positive
hey awesome vid i was a data analyst before i had a maternity leave and i wanted so much to become a data scientist because i think its a logical progression of my work challenge path unfortunately currently i have different plans for my life but i wanted to say that you made me come back to my prev plans and inspired me again on the topic,positive
great video im quite interested in pursuing a career in data science in the future and im wondering if youve got any tipstricks for someone whos somewhat got his basics down looking forward to more of your videos,positive
i have a very similar background to you i am a former physics undergraduate that did research in high energy physics simulations and that computational background really helped me transition into my current data science position for any physicsmath undergrads you have the skill set to get into this field the only obstacle is being able to express your math knowledge through code if you can learn enough code to do that youre golden,positive
thank you for this video currently applying for a masters in data science and this is great anecdotal support,positive
very informative video i agree with many of your points and id like to add some of my own im a lead data scientist at an american unicorn 1 we dont really care about your background as long as you can code sql and python understand the fundamentals of statistics and can apply standard ml models your education might limit your progress later on but the basics are plenty enough for you to do well as an entrylevel data scientist 2 communication is really important we expect all new hires to be good on the technical side so what ends up being the most significant discriminator between high and lowlevel is how well you can understand whats being requested and whats important and communicate your results in a way that helps the business this is the number 1 thing i mention to my reports during 11s 3 many data science courses bas or masters dont teach sql or if they do its just basic stuff regardless of what your actual role as a data scientist will be sql will always be essential,positive
super informative thank you for all the info i just switched majors from cs to it and thinking of pursuing a masters degree in data science do you think that the masters degree would make of a difference early on and for entry level roles salary wise overall im just kind of trying to figure out where to go from here haha,positive
thank you so much for the insight on data science as a new path i have degree on agriculture and now im just starting on takin course professional certification and etc in data science im more interested into this stuff than my main degree tbh lol mainly just to get into ds job and also getting new skill to go along with my main degree seems pretty nice addition,positive
thank you for this course sir it was a great 12 hour journey coming from non cs background i had little to no knowledge about all this stuff but this video has given me enormous amount of confidence that i can program and explore data science further thanks again,positive

that’s a great concise video summing up the role of a professional data scientist this video came at the right moment as i transition from academia to industry and totally relate with many of the points mentioned in the video as mentioned in the later part of the video i also find the undesirable aspect of data science to be a doubleedged sword as on one end the ambiguity may make things unclear but at the same time also leaves room for experimentation and innovation papaya tracker sounds like an interesting personal project,positive
im 35 years old and i just started my data science journey by starting college this semester been an aircraft mechanic for my entire adult life and been looking for a change for years now and you inspired me to finally pursue data science thank you ken ill be tuning into your channel just to keep my ear to the ground in this exciting field also not sure if you spoke on this before but what laptop do you recommend for data science thanks buddy and keep up the good work,positive
miss the times when data science was simply called statistics now every company wants a “data scientist” that can do 1 business management 2 presentations 3 data fetching and collection 4 research 5 model building and deployment 6 model performance evaluation 7 cloud environments 8 database administration 9 pipeline building and management 10 client management with statistician the responsibilities where quite clear because now every person that works on anything related to data is now a data scientist,neutral
this actually answered a couple of questions i had about working professionally i know that sw engineers typically work in an agile framework but wasnt sure if data science followed that same trend thanks ken now to watch this 400000 more times so we can beat forrest,positive
one of the most important things that i wish more people would do is documentation of datasets sources code rationale etc i often have to spend a long time on the dataset exploration phase of the project and trying to figure out things everything would be much smoother if people created detailed documents on the different datasets how things are collected what features are used distributions etc,positive
i’m 26 and i have one year left in my data science curriculum plus my master’s program currently learning mysql and i’m trying to learn python and r on the side it’s really tough since i’m in a data structures course using java and that takes up a good bit of my time hopefully it all works out for the best also trying to get a good grasp on machine learning and deep learning principles as i go and making sure i’m sharp with my statistics and linear algebra skills,positive

if you want a role where you want to work only with ai and heavy duty programming go for a machine learning engineer job if you want to do statistics and sometimes classic ml and analyze data go for a data scientist job working as a ml engineer you spend way more time reviewing and maintaining code so its more se from one side you use python for model development and cjava for production the role is building ai products so you are all day reviewing extracting and preprocessing data to then training ml models evaluate them and match required kpis in the other hand data scientists positions offer what is described in the video statistics and data preparation engineering and classic ml there is more flexibility regarding tools and programming languages and the final purpose is bringing value in a business perspective with the projects you have for example in ml engineering you get assigned some set of models that you have to maintain and improve in data scientist positions you get several projects that constantly change both roles have their advantages and interesting scopes i have been in both my background is in statistics and i have been working as ml engineer in computer vision in the automotive industry for the last 3 years personally i can say ml engineering is more fun even more in start ups where you feel you bring a lot of value with your ideas about crazy ai methods,neutral

i dont agree with any of this the only way to get a data science job is to first get a job as a janitor at an esteemed university start looking for math problems on chalk boards solve them become a professor solve math wait this is the plot from good will hunting nevermind in hindsight this is really great advice how about them apples,positive
great video tina loving the minimize input maximize output mimo series my step into the world of data was from a nontechnical biology background and persistence and grit was probably one of the most important thing because it took quite some time to digest the coding or algorithmic concepts i also resonated with your prior mimo video on learning data science particularly on learning just enough and start doing projects i also leveraged data science to solve biology data problem that helps to make a positive impact in this video which at the time was a novel thing i repeated this cycle for solving various biology data problems and before you know it topics that i used to get stuck on became less intimidating and started to sink in your persistence through 200 swe roles is very inspirational ,positive
hey tina thank you so much for always sharing wonderful tips it is almost approaching a year since i had finished my bachelors and still without a job i really hope i can break the barrier and get my foot in the industry having zero experience makes everything harder apart from doing some projects i will definitely try to contribute in open source projects or pick up a consulting assignment,positive

amazing how much effort so many people put into to getting a job while someone with connection can bypass it all and get the job,positive
hi tina this was really great advice about demonstrating your impact super useful for data science people but i feel like its relevant to every field too please could you do a video on how you deal with rejection im job hunting in a field thats very new to me not data science at the moment and im just so afraid of getting rejected because that could mean the end of my dream also even if it doesnt the feeling just sucks lol,negative
hi tina do you think doing only analysis is good for your resume for example imagine that i scrape data from glassdoor and i do a analysis on the salaries of data scientists in the us after finishing the analysis on the data i got some pretty cool insights but i didnt use machine learning in the end project so is a project like that good for my resume im a major in data science and your videos help a lot,positive
honestly the frustrating thing for me at work as data analystscientist is i never saw our clients give any feedback about how our reports were helpful for them and change their projects aka business impact like what you described i always comfort myself that even just a little impact and thats enough,negative
hi tina you make me want to make my first comment on youtube your videos are super helpful and please keep making more interesting and insightful videos i am actually thinking of transitioning to data science from a business background and you gave me a lot of useful tips that solves my confusion,positive
hmmm im going the applied math route with stats as a minor or possibly masters is there any reason in particular that you would recommend compsci beyond just the programming background it provides also how different is data science compared to machine learning they sound almost like the same thing given their job descriptions great video btw,positive
glad we needed a scientist to tell us that you get rich by starting a business with a competitive advantage,positive
i feel for a local business owner who opened up a coffee shop my two sisters worked there and were very good friends with the owner since she was a teacher at the highschool and saved up enough money to open the shop up sadly during the pandemic my state nuked her businesses my sisters lost their jobs while the governor praised herself about her actions and those evil businesses were destroying our state she then proceeded to get caught twice having parties spending thousands on booze actually watched dozens of business get nuked the same way fun times fun times,negative
so as a technician i worked at a dealership two actually owned by the same guy he has like 10 different dealerships and he is insanely wealthy like he owns all of this property north of a major highway and is literally like a king in these lands to be honest he also seems like a pretty nice guy,positive
since i was little i knew i’d rather live in the street than become a wage slave and have to relive the school experience of being told what to do having to negotiate with incompetent managers for a 5 increase every year just sounds insane to me i studied software engineering so i could build my own tools and sell them took countless 70 hour work weeks but the work does pay off now own half of a successful tech startup currently using that income to start two other companies with virtually no competition in my area in other industries i’m interested in entrepreneurship is the way made my first m at 26 currently 27,negative

this actually makes a lot of sense the company i work for has produced a lot of commercials for a regional car dealershipracing team owner the owner of the company isn’t a billionaire but is in a position where he can throw around money whenever he wants that kind of path seems much more attainable than hoping you land a one in a million chance on a startup business or some bitcoin related gamble,neutral
im a mortgage broker hes completely right except the local monopoly thing can be done with a really good book of business sure you can compete but you cant steal my referrals which supply all the business offering a lower price is a poor tactic unless its purely how to learn how to run the business,neutral
depends also on what you define as rich i dont mean that in a philosophical way either just that living standards vary greatly from person to person if you need to have a mansion a yacht and 5 or 6 super cars then its a much greater challenge also what are the time horizons is your goal to be rich before you turn 30 or can you wait until 45 or 50 because something else they didnt mention in the video is investment compounding interest passive income etc,neutral
being a trade professional such as plumbing or hvac can be very lucrative if you spend the time and money to consistently build name recognition in your local market and maintain that for years if you can become the name that people automatically think of for hvac problems you can multiple hire crews to do the work for you you can scale as big as you want and easily become a millionaire with a tech school diploma you just have to grow that name recognition and provide quality service,positive
remember he’s a data scientist he’s probably studied data on the topic immensely before this interview as that’s what we love doing especially with public data that’s nice to play with so the advice he’s giving probably tends to bounce towards what’s most probable not what will definitely make you rich in most ways probability can you take you a long way,positive

the difference between a senior and junior data analyst how well you’re able to formulate your question on stack overflow perhaps i should make a video about this,neutral
amazing content stefan i’m currently a student at a university in florida majoring in business analytics and information systems which yeah basically trained you to become a data analyst i’m a senior now but i feel like i learned shit in the last 3 years despite getting all a and paying tons of money i learned from your videos way more than in the college classroom,positive
considering i am extremely broke this was massively helpful bc you recommended free ways to learn various things and i desperately need that i also need to know what skills will be most useful to hiring managers and recruiters and how to effectively prove it in my cv so that was also very appreciated the very structured approach to this video was extremely helpful thank you very much,positive
i cannot tell you how much i appreciate this video nowhere else ive seen someone telling it like it is in such a concise way thank you subscribed to lukes channel following your recommendation as i also see data analysis as a stepping stone,positive

thanks a ton brother that was really resourceful and the exact advice i was looking for  also if you could suggest any useful certifications to consider that would add up well in the profile that would be great thanks again ,positive
its so important that people like you come up with such good content in order to teach folks that data science is not just about programming language and applying random ml libraries to get 90 efficiency like you said math and stat is always the key and everyone should start with that even though we dont often use it in real world scenario in companies,positive
this video was helpful im currently a ux researcher and have my feet in both qualitative and quantitative research where the quantitative requires a lot of data analysis i enjoy diving into data but wasnt sure which route i should take for my particular job to build out more of a niche in a quant ux researcher role now i feel like i know more of what i want to dive into further and want to focus more on the data analysis route,positive

thank you so much i was literally feeling lost to figure out what should i learn first python r sql now i got hope thank you so much for your videos,positive
i absolutely agree with your comments about statistics and i loveownhave read the same book cover to cover there is now a 2nd edition with python implementation btw reason i am leaving comment is to hear your thought about the actual interview questions i recently went through google data scientist interview 1 hour tech screen and to my surprise the question was straight out coin flip probability and expectation problem i was really surprised because the question is very much contrived and i couldnt come up with the answer very easily at first that was the only question some resume related question before that of course i got in the session as a data scientist myself those type of questions are really hit or miss and personally i dont think itd help to measure ones understanding of stats or technical background how would you suggest prepare those,positive
thank you for such an informative video appreciate people from real time experienceare sharing it with people which will he a great help to so many im working as a software engineer but dont think im good at technical so was thinking to move to non technical roles and these thoughts are really tiring when u end up in too many options and not able to conclude i am with bsc maths and msc computers background and in 2016 thought searched so much how to utilise my maths skills in it but unfortunately couldnt find so much that timenow when i hear on data scene i feel i lost so much opportunity but i would like to resstart my learning and your videos are really inspiring is it okay for a person with almost 8years gap from bsc maths to start on data science now please reply,positive
thanks for sharing your experience in transitioning to data scientist role some of your suggestion is good which is actually what im doing so far watching different you tube video on on same topic because as you pointed out different people has their own way of interpretation of the subject and is more simplified until you fully grasp the subject please keep sharing your knowledge,positive
valuable content and glad to see someone pointing out a book they read because its not easy to pick a good book as theres many of them thank you for sharing,positive

i’ve been been watching all of your videos while stressing about midterms currently still in my undergrad and i’m looking for a bit of advice currently i’m planning on majoring in computer science with a minor in statistics would a data analytics or information systems degree from the business school be better or should i stick with the more technical with cs with the stats minor looking at data science jobs nearly all of them i see require a masters degree or phd which i definitely don’t have the money for i see plenty of data analyst and data engineer jobs that are open to the bachelor degree level candidates is making a transition from one of those two rolls into data science relativity easy,neutral
great video thanks for sharing all of your experiences how difficult was it to be proficient in spark it’s such a different mindset,positive

very informative i’ve got an engineering degree and had courses like probability statistics linear algebra integral and differential calculus i have a letter of acceptance from a community college in canada for business and advanced analytics in a post grad diploma program with subjects like python sql machine learning etc i’m studying python and data science online at the moment in preparation for my winter 2023 intake will brush up my knowledge on statistics linear algebra and calculus by august as this is a requirement by the program back in the days i had the opportunity to represent our school in math competitions what surprises me is that i can still study for 5 8 straight hours everyday and sometimes forgetting my businesses as i now leave my managers to decide on their own what do you think are the chances of people in their mid 40’s getting a job without experience as a data analyst or data scientist,positive
do you resonate more with software engineering or data science let me know in the comments below,neutral
software engineering vs data scientist 1 building vs discovering 2 clearlydefined vs interdisciplinary 3 welldefined career progression vs flexibility 4 coding as passion vs coding as a skill 5 lower vs higher entrance barriers,neutral
this helped me realise that i am more interested in building things rather than discovering them what a great and informative video thank you tina,positive
i have a masters of data science but once i started working in a data position i have realized that i enjoy more of the coding and building whether its writing python sql or r code for building and analyzing data or building reports in ssrs those are the aspects of my job that i most enjoy i have been considering changing careers to software engineering also i do feel like data scientists are expected to know too much these days from communication data visualization statistics and deep learning to cloud platforms spark and now docker that is a ton of skill and knowledge that seems superhuman,positive
you are the chill girl in every class who says she hasnt studied for exam but tops the whole college,neutral
great explanation building products vs discovering insights,positive
as someone who is working in the data analytics side i wholeheartedly agree with this data science is a new field which basically supports or optimizes how to do business software engineering leans more on building software or applications where normal people can useconsume if you want to create your own business in the tech industry software engineering should be necessary if you want to support existing businesses data science is the way im planning to create my own business on the food industry and i can see that data science can help it a lot,positive
thanks for the informative video just a caveat on the salary comparison data science often requires graduatelevel education masters or phdconsiders it an asset whereas software engineers do not or if without a graduate degree its not uncommon to work as a data analyst for 12 years before becoming a data scientist so while the average salary may be higher for data scientists theres likely some additional educationwork experience factored in,positive
this is the most systematic and detailed review of any of the two careers i’ve ever seen thanks for this video it definitely helped in finding my next step,positive
this helped me soo much i was really on the fence but im leaning towards software development just because i have serious doubts that i could present the data in a parsableusable way i like coding so ill stick with that but i also love working with numbers so im hoping i can land a data analyst job somewhere down the line thanks for providing the insight,positive
this is the video everyone should watch when starting to learn data science  so many great lessons in this thu ,positive

as someone whos a relatively new data scientist thanks for giving me all the confirmation bias that i needed ken ,positive
mathematics never dies programming languages are rising and decline but calculus matrices and numerics will exists until the known universe ends,neutral
great insights ken i certainly agree that data sciences decline is far from sight in the life science domain the use of data science has started to scratch the surface and theres a whole new frontier of possibilities,positive
the sentiment is maybe coming from the difficulties to find your fist job if you are an aspiring data scientist rejection and unclear expectations most companies have no idea how to find and sort datascientists may make many believe that is was just a fad and they came a little late to the party,negative
as a student in data science in order to automate those tasks ai needs to be much more advanced in order to actually do it so its still pretty far off,neutral

hi priya thank you for this video i am concluding my last year as a student receiving my bs in data analytics and i have so many questions that are causing me anxiety as i am nearing the end of my journey i have realized that the path in computer science dsda is not structured like one probably imagined it would be what i am wondering is if you encountered the same during your journey in terms of learning these program tools python sql tableau r if what’s important while in school is getting a basic understanding of these tools and how to use them but the real challenge starts after graduating in teaching yourself on how to use these tools more effectively to actually be able to draw meaningful insights did you have to hone your skills a bit more once you graduated before you started to apply to jobs i have beginner level on all these programs right now but i feel like i probably won’t be able to land a job in data analytics until i’m at least intermediate in sql and at least python for starters i would appreciate your feedback and would also love to connect with you offline to chat if possible congratulations again on your journey and your role in data science,negative

1000 this is an extremely hard coding task it deals with a custom datatype implies the iteration and verification of the end i wasted 40 minutes and didnt resolve it all the solutions i have found include flattering with a separate method than iterating and len verification and the task is formalized in a way that next and hasnext methods should be enough to do the flattening which is again more difficult i am not sure if it is a suitable task for a middle software developer in a fortune500 company coding interview comparing this with the explanation of the gradient descend is like chalk and cheese,negative
i’ve just concluded my bachelors in civil engineering but i am inclined to move to the data science field during my course i learned how to program in phythonin spyder and sql and i’m still updated with those skills imagine you are in my shoes what should i do moving forward to learn more about data science and ensure i can get a job at it do you think it is necessary to take another course what are the general technical skills i have to master,neutral
great video i appreciate the honesty did you start as an analyst before moving to a data scientist role what role would you recommend for recent grads,positive
a scientist who works in data science has been a godsend finding a job has been difficult in the wake of my graduation and several unsuccessful job applications after weighing my options i chose to leave physics and hunt for a position in data science before seeing your videos i was baffled as to why i continued being turned down for jobs despite having two masters degrees one in physics and the other in applied physics now that ive seen some of your vids i understand why glad i found your channel on youtube,positive

i love your videos i had one quibble about your sql solution to 1 if some publishers have more videos than others then their video durations will affect the mean you could imagine one publisher with 10000 videos and 9 publishers with 10 videos in this case the average duration of that one superpublishers videos will have way more influence on the mean than the other publishers i think your question is better answered by first computing an average for each publisher and then averaging those averages of course this detail may not matter in an interview,positive

dude love the cut outs great video,positive
maaaaaan the way you explain stuff makes me feel like this is something reachable despite of its level of complexity you make it sound somehow easy not because it is but because you suggest a self development path for those who want to learn on their own there are many out there who put themselves on a superior position maybe caused by their formaleducation ego but for some reason you must follow their same steps which means youll never be as awesome as they are thanks for breaking it down for humans big hug from argentina and keeping on rocking with that good work ,positive
update comment i’m one month into my new career as a data analyst at a large charter school company over 20 analysts on our team i just wanted to come back here and say thank you i focused on positions within education changing from a 14 year career as a math teacher and landed a position within a month of starting my job search sql and excel are used a lot my advice to anyone starting out is to get comfortable with those two programs especially inner joins with sql and pivottables with excel,positive
fantastic video as a ba i can attest that sql and excel are still very much in demand after being at one job for 15 years i had to put myself back on the market after doing the excel sql and powerbi assessments on linkedin to back my resume ahead of the screenings the jobs and some cool offers started rolling right in,positive

i have been a data scientist for three years as a data scientist one can only be a generalist until and unless he has domain knowledge of the field his company works in the fascination with data science dies down once the projects are not relevant to your field of interestdomain of expertise moreover companies now have a hard time justifying the massive amount of investment done towards data science its better to be a domain expert and then add skills of data science rather than just being a generalist data scientist without any domain expertise hence im leaving data science and starting my phd ,neutral
i am a structural engineer this is a good field for data science since most civil engineers dont learn programmingcoding and when they do they just shift to it industry data science will be very crucial for monitoring the life of structures,positive
i agree to some points but disagree to some i dont think studying data science and knowledge gained will be worthless in 510 years the core statistics and maths learned in the degree will be useful decades to come yes some aspects of tech stack will change but the same thing happens in other computer science fields as well the data science is very broad field and if one does degree in this field they can transfer those skills into multitude of other fields and can create value for the company and lastly career trajectory in this field is still not fixed as this is nascent field and we dont know how things will pan out in 1020 years down the line,neutral
dear sir data analyst and data scientist shares a lots and lots of diffrence btw them data scientist have to deal with ai which requires data to built an algorithm based on machine learningself driving cars requires ai biotechnology companies requires ai and in the age of aino one can stops ai and data scientist to thriveand every profession always have pros and consnothing in world is perfectask yourself siris computer science was in demand back 20yrsas it was now,neutral
namaste sir that was a really informative video actually a lot of professors from iits also have quoted this issue of growing false love among students for data science ai the whole crux is that these things are just merely tools to solve research problems in other domains and thus making computational easier just like a bridge which connects two islands most people do not understand this logic and hence go forward in this career because it is in demand you have demystified many myths via this video  also sir what is your take on pursuing advance degree in nanotechnology because am an ece student and really interested to do research in this area,neutral

thanks so much for clearing it out i am learning data science on my own i started learning statistics few months ago almost done i was a little confused and restless if i made the right choice by learning statistics first i read a lot of comments on quora where people said that coding should be the first step it didnt make much sense to me now its all clear and i have gained confidence after watching your video i have a similar road map to what you just said thanks so much for inspiring and giving us so much info all the best and really looking forward to watch your future videos,positive

i started making game yday second attempt here too 1 year ago i tried and failed and im so happy when i heard that what im going through is normal its really hard to stick to something nowadays and when you said something about making game simple so you dont quit i really felt that lmao anyways good luck on making gta 6 in 2023 mate,positive
really humorous and inspiring great stuff,positive
this was a really interesting video ive been toying around with the idea of making my own game after seeing toby fox and eric barone do it on their own but ive always feared the learning process when i probably should have been excited for it on a side note are you dutch or belgian a lot of my favourite content creators have a similar accent to yours and ive taken note of how many content creators there are from these countries makes me wonder if certain culturally facilitated living standards leads to more content creators,positive

making games has never been easier making a good game will forever be hard,neutral
this video is really good and legit i do however want to point out that you can still accomplish huge things in game design on your own or with a small team this day in age there are incredibly powerful tools available for cheap and even free the learning process to build an entire game is long and difficult especially if youre thinking of an rpg in my experience single player games can be done fairly simply with alot of knowledge and experience multiplayer games are a stretch to even tryalone or with a small team but dont let the reality beat you up if you really really want something you can make it happen ive been making games with blender and unity for nearly 6 years and have prototypedconcepted my own rpg 5 times only now in 2022 am i confident enough to build the official version but ive done it ive learned enough to make it happen and you can too knowing is one thing then you have to put in the years of hard work that still exist to bring it to life creation is king never give up,positive
as a solo game developer whenever i want to implement a new thing i get crushed by the overwhelming amount of details ive to do thank you for the video,neutral

it certainly feels like having 10 jobs at once while still working a regular job to finance your development,neutral
games are the most complex type of media cause they take all aspects of creativity together,positive
solo dev here and the part about marketing is totally true my game shameless plug link on my channel trailer was a complex effort where i learned a lot about animation music and sound mixing some seemingly simple things like sound settings and zoom took the longest during development and when it was all over people who played my game said it was pretty good but it was hardly even seen by anyone the marketing thing was something i never considered so its going to be a focus with my next game i made a game and this video was so incredibly accurate to my journey learning how much work everything is and my scope was too big in places and that i naively expected steam to give me enough visibility to get the game out there if anyones wondering how accurate this video is the answer is somewhere around 120 great video too editing was great and music was well chosen,positive
i come from indie to aaa studio as game programmer if theres something to add every discipline has it own depths on knowledge perfecting stuff like design pattern design principle code conventions cicd pipeline automate test etc for programmers is needed when your project grow that come along as other department maybe at the first time you think you wont need dedicated project manager that handling all daily task and scrum but when project get larger team gets bigger you will need that one and for indie who grow to bigger company usually overwhelmed with this kind of situation heck if you love making games later on you wont even touch the project as too many things on managerial you will handle on if you just started game dev make sure that one day what you want to become is pretty clear will you create your own studio or work for big companies which discipline what studio this can be matter as a programmer artist who need align their technology artstyle there so much to prepare and i cant write all of those question in one post hope everyone who read this post can consider your journey even harder not make you scared of gamedev but thinking more critically because this could be your future work and huge part of your life,neutral

its two different things to start learning and to make your first serious game when you start learning if you go straight away to make your dream game it will likely be frustrating because you have a vision of the game in your head but you can barely translate any of that vision into an actual game creating a copy or a remake of an already existing game that you like is a good way to learn when i started learning unity some years ago after doing a few tutorials i decided i would create a remake of duke nukem 3d using some of the assets of duke nukem forever and remaking the first level of the game in blender this was so that i could focus mainly on the coding side of things and put the creative part of it aside for the project it took me i believe 6 months to finish it it had all the basic game mechanics and the first level of the game and yes it played terrible and nothing like the original but the amount of learning i did thanks to this learning project was really a lot i dont think i could have learned faster other way another point i would mention is learning to code i think was the most important thing i did when i started making games my game ideas were limited to what i imagined i would be technically capable of implementing after i got a good grasp of coding i feel and i know i could make anything i can imagine given the time to do so,neutral
i love how you are being open to your community this helps the community to feel engaged in your projects anyways i feel like this advice of yours can really help me in what i need to do so thanks hope you have a great day also what if you release your pizzatime game to public xd,positive
honestly cant thank you enough for this im just starting off picking an engine and while im going to be doing it solo a lot of this advice is helpful beyond just game development being a visual artist as well i can actually attest to how important the bit about isolation is nothing gasses up your motivation like being able to cross pollinate ideas and support each other,positive
i am so excited to start my dev journey thankyou for the inspo,positive
one year insane im gonna get there 11 months to go,positive
okay everyone scroll down to see the correct answers for the problem 1 polygon all meshes are made from polygons within games polygons must be 3 sidedtriangles though typically in animation and 3d design polygons are 4 sided 2 code all it needs is code so we can start giving the ball commands on what to do and when 3 3d in almost all scenarios will run slower in comparison almost anything can slow down a game though an 8k 2d image with an intense shadermaterial will put a lot more stress on the game than a normal 3d model,neutral
i feel more confident that i can actually learn gamedev knowing yanderedev made something that a lot of people enjoyed and he didnt even know most of the info in this video,positive
can’t wait to make my first game for the airplane ,positive
ive been a dev for 3 years and have never had development explained in this way i think this is one of the best development videos for beginners,positive
1 polygons or tris more specifically 2 you would add code preferably a character controller 3 the sphere would make the game run slowest,neutral
just what i needed to know to start making my first game call of mario,positive
timestamps 109 main pic 130 scenes 250 effects 354 assets 700 code 842 systems 1026 problem,neutral
been a game developer for 5 years and you opened my eyes to the fact that all of this info isnt common knowledge and theres people who live without it and i was once one of them thanks for giving me a system error you earned a sub,neutral
such a great simplified yet essential breakdown,positive
i feel like he is that one computer coding teacher that actually put it in a way that we understand thanks for the basics ,positive

i really can agree with it increased my appreciation for those games since ive got into game dev i know hoooow much work for exaple aaa games like red dead 2 are,positive
i just finished my first month of learning game dev with unity and seeing this motivates me and excites me to see just how much i can learn in the next 2 months thanks for this video,positive
preoptimisation is my biggest weakness as a sw engineer it kills a lot of passion and motivation for projects if it’s not perfect it’s very hard to correct,negative
love how you added rpg maker as a game engine there very underated but very amazing,positive
sometimes being an organized individual has its cons when it comes to increased task anxiety in not being able to keep a rigid schedule sounds like many others here in the comments can relate as well just gotta go with the flow and see the results build up over time,neutral
im not sure how i got recommended this from the youtube algorithm but im glad i did after mindlessly eating half a box of cheezits and finishing the video i was surprised to see the view count the editing was great and i was thoroughly intrigued i havent seen any other of your videos but i hope you get one that blows up you seem to be going in the right direction though because i got recommended this video despite sparingly watching tech content best of luck,positive
thank you for making this i fall into the trap of scheduling too i’ve recently adopted your method of just working on it when i want to it makes the dev much more enjoyable using monogame instead of unity tho amazing video,positive
“i thought it would ruin the magic of video games” if anything it enhances it tenfold for me anyway i love thinking about how things could possibly be programmed whenever i’m playing a game sometimes i think of how i would tell a computer to complete daily tasks like pouring a glass of water,positive
finalbossblues is awesome ive been subscribed for ages for my own projects and i know the number of tutorials isnt quite as high but i would recommend godot to 2d beginners its relatively clean and easy to pick up completely open source and less than 1gb i think the steam version is 950mb but the full package straight off the website is closer to 100mb and yet still fully functional so very quick and easy to try out i really like gdscript pythonesque and the scene heirarchy is pretty intuitive i admit i keep getting hung up on optimisation not just because like you i work in another development area during my day job but because i want anything i make to be playable on a potato if possible but it really slows downhalts my progress need to shoulder my way through that like you recommend,positive
thankyou so much for your support over the last few weeks its honestly been so crazy also make sure you join the discord server,positive
tbh this gives me inspiration being someone who has wanted to make games since a very very young age i have had the idea to make my own little studio called the crying arcade and im just now learning how to do stuff seeing the amount of progress you made with just a moving cube it genuinely gives me hope it makes me feel like i have a chance thanks man,positive
after 1 year in unity i see you have improved so much keep it up at this rate you will hit 10k 100k or even 1m,positive
thats great your history of creating video games is so interesting such motivation to start unity,positive
i really want to learn c in unity so this is definitely something to look up to,positive
your first games are actually very impressive the problem i had and have rn is learning coding on unity there is now where to learn c,positive
the rate at which youre growing is amazing you had 2k subscribers 2 months ago and now you have over 30k wish you the best for the future of this channel,positive
i am a complete beginner at game dev and this vid really inspired me to keep going so thanks for making this vid,positive
hey man… keep up the good work your progress is amazing,positive
awesome video very inspiring just started my c journey a while back and gonna be jumping in unity soon i hope i will be making as much progress as you did damn,positive
hi everyone i realized i didnt actually describe my first role in the industry but it was essentially focused on monetization within games thats why ethical monetization is my specialty now so for sure theres data analysis because we need to be comfortable with leveraging large amounts of data to make good decisions it also encompasses monetization and systems design though i wasnt formally trained in monetization design before joining its actually not a common designer specific skill so most of us learn this skill by joining the industry first monetization design encompasses things like battle passes loot box designs game ecoystem design hard currency to soft currency what resources are tradable and purchasable etc designing events and seasons what content should be available how is it distributed what does progression and rewards look like in an event etc and ofc the pricing of it all we also need to have business savvy because we need to lay out beforehand what success looks like and determine if the choices we make are good ones we often look at things like player sentiment and satisfaction purchase regret mau revivals etc to get a sense of this my role today though focuses on a broader list of things not just monetization but particularly engagement and retention as well i made a video about what the responsibilities are so feel free to check that out,positive
this video was really inspiring and insightful to watch thank you for sharing your story and also the tip on “skillset to interest framework” i never thought of that idea especially since i am someone who doesn’t necessarily know what roles i would be a best fit for but also that matches my current skillset still in the process of exploration anyways thank you for the video,positive
great to hear your story was an amazing journey please use your smarts for good and make game monetization less predatory for all who play the games you work on its an incredibly important issue and im so happy to hear that people are thinking about and specializing in work like that,positive
hi morgan just want to tell you that i really loved the skillset to interest framework it really did a good job im not a gamerelated worker but this thing helps me up to retrospect my career skill set thanks for making this video,positive
loved this video there are so many videos that just say do this this and youll eventually get into the industry but you managed to break your journey down into a series of manageable steps looking forward to seeing more content from you,positive
only halfway into the video the way of breaking down the job roles within the industry has been immensely helpful and information friendly to new gamers designers or hopefuls wanting to join the game industry,positive
tldr shes not a game developer shes a salesbusiness analystprogram manager this video didnt really help me but others might find your mechanism useful if they are interested in considering job requirements to your skill set framework which to me seems obvious but nothing wrong with that,neutral
its a very informative video and its genuinely interesting to hear your journey on the other hand the title is definitely a clickbait the video has very little to do with how to become a developer rev analyst is not a developer nor is the product manager role,positive
morgan this is awesome one because i love league of legends been playing since like season 6 and its just amazing to see people that have a vision for their life plan work hard to achieve it and succeed im one of those as well got a degree in neurosciencepsychology fell in love with web dev learned the skills that i needed and been working as a web dev for about 6 months and life has been a dream ever since,positive
so basically you arent a game dev youre a production manager,neutral
for every wishlist ill do another pushup,neutral
you have achieved more in 2 years that a whole team of people in 3 absolutely phenomenal,positive
congrats on two years of exciting development incredibly inspiring,positive
congrats man on your 2 years youre a legend,positive
dude honestly this just looks amazing and i think its simply inspiring to see someone make this possible it means we could do it as well maybe if we work as hard as you,positive
i remember seeing your first devlog 2 years ago and just knowing it wasnt going to be another one of those indie games that devs drop after a few months and boy was i right i havent seen a more polished amazing looking well thought out fun indie game in my entire life and i dont think i will ever see anything like this again if i was you i would be extremely proud of myself for making something as cool as this and same goes to everyone who helped you i cannot wait to be able to play this but i cant even wait to see these dev logs at the end of each month awesome work keep it up and best of luck 1740 also i think these humanoid characters will really go far in this game even if they arent enemies and no matter how hard they are to animate i really think its going to make your game stand out from traditional indie games as if it doesnt enough also to whoever concepted the humanoid characters awesome job looks dope,positive
noice congrats on 2 years the concept art for enemies and missions is looking sick and im excited for what the future holds ,positive
ive been watching since the start this is the best devlog ever and i cant wait till its done,positive
bro this is genuinly nuts an inspiration to a lot of us the amount you have got done and learned in 2 years is crazy good job,positive
its absolutely nuts that this is your first game project and it looks so promising already just imagine what youll be able to do in the future if this one is a success,positive
i didnt know mark is such a pretty good artist those art concepts and sprites for his old game ideas looks really nice i always thought the phase of prototype is always super important to make sure if a game is gonna be good i think is possible to already have these characters and this music and this story if thats the goal of a game still i can see how game design can evolved those concepts into something more fitting for whatever the gameplay can be,positive
im the dev who integrated 2d physics into unity and i thoroughly enjoyed watching this i think ill be going into the attic to dig out my folder of ideas from my youth too,positive
reminds me of the first semester of my game design masters we had a course that was just making a game in groups of 5 after week 1 of production everyone presented their current state and this one game just looked amazing i felt so jealous of how quickly they got their game looking so beautiful but when the proffessor was giving feedback he asked why does it look so pretty as a critique for this exact reason he seemed almost mad they made things so pretty so early because it was too early too tell if their idea worked yet they had spent time making it look amazing,positive
gmt dont over think or over prepare your game me with adhd and wanting to make a metroidvania style game visible sadness,negative
i really recommend you checking out a book “the art of game design” and it’s chapter about prototyping it really nicely explains the purpose of prototypes and that even though your first prototype answered your question of “is there a potential in this design” it’s a good idea to create more prototypes which are going to help you answer more questions about uncertain things before you settle on something and go into full production mode great video i think more people should know this stuff,positive
to summarize if you dont make a cheap and fast prototype for your game then your game is an overdeveloped prototype and good luck with that,positive
tldr mark learned to “focus on the primary loop” looks amazing already mark,positive
have you considered using the recoil of the magnet when you catch it to give you a little push maybe as a kind of directional double jump,neutral
another really important aspect of prototyping is learning whether you actually enjoy game design or not if youre having more fun coming up with the story setting lore and themes than you are experimenting with gameplay ideas then chances are youre more into worldbuilding than game design learning this early can help steer you towards your strengths and interests,positive
hey man ive been building these lets call them prototypes for many years im a programmer and game designer and always wanted to be ever since a kid and been following that passion since ye old newground days but when it comes to art i just shut down im genuinely awful at the art part so ive always teamed up with artists problem is i then get bogged down with the project management aspect and art pipeline systems instead of the art that its wildly impacted my focus on the gameplay aspect and it suffers as a result eventually everyone burns out and the project peters off for something new and shiny using what weve learned i know this stupid vicious cycle well,negative
most of what youre talking about here is called abstraction despecifying capabilities in order to make them generic and reusable as well as linking related settings and configurations to minimize the effort required to make further changes its a core tenet of software development and my primary concern when designing application enhancements for my job id much rather spend the extra time up front designing something that not only solves the current issue but also related past issues as well as potential future ones in the end if done well it significantly reduces overall complexity while skyrocketing maintainability its also a puzzle that i tend to take as personal challenges,neutral
and yes i realize that future mark problems are starting to stack up a bit welcome to game development or software development in general or really making anything,neutral
now that mark knows how to make games he can take part in the gmtk game jam one of the biggest game jams ever,positive
just to clarify it for everyone whos starting when mark said its worth putting in some extra effort at the beginning he did not mean before the mvp before you havent first inspected your core ideas are worth pursuing and which are not fail fast fail early inspect and adapt,neutral
i’m so grateful that you focused on the “boring stuff” in this video it was very illuminating thanks,positive
here is my feedback i totally got the eureka moments in every level it will be easier to automatically grab de magnet i got softlocked many times so the restart was nice i dunno if it will be better for players to get less stuck than the reset initially i thought i should return to the key hub that made me feel as if the level endings were anticlimactic ill love to move while aiming it feels more fluent the key as a concept and progress tracker is nice but i dont know how well it fits in the game the doors werent like the key type so it doesnt make sense to open them with it also its kinda weird to just throw them thru the pipe maybe a fuse or something that restores the energy will be better maybe it will be nice if the polarity affects the magnet character for example making the positive smile and the negative sad the main character could shine more while aiming maybe a subtle movement in the eyes following the aim overall i loved it and am really thankful that it was free for everyone so i could try it ,positive
imagine being talented and dedicated enough to not just make a game on your own but also make a high quality video series detailing your design processes at the same time really amazing stuff,positive
and so i abused my internet fame to get someone much smarter than me to build that exact thing i just described fantastic line ,negative
love this series ill admit i was a little sceptical when you changed things on your channel but i am really enjoying this maybe even more than the video essay type videos kutgw 3,positive
as a game developer i have always taken the boring stuff incredibly seriously if you want to maximize efficiency when developing your game you have to work on your framework before you even try working on the entire games campaign or whatever else in fact and i discovered this the same way you did mark by building that framework often times you will accidentally end up building an mvp or demo at the same time i did this as well im still working on my first game but just recently i started closing in on the final lines of code for my unreal engine 5 framework that i will be using for my current game and all future titles in the franchise until my studio moves to a proprietary engine whenever we get the resources to pull it off as in when im not the only employee well im working on my framework and i look at the level ive built alongside it to not only test the framework features but also to figure out what else needed to be added and i realized i basically just built a prealpha demo for my game all i need is to make the level actually look good because my level design skills are awful and i basically now have a prealpha project its funny how that can happen sometimes either way i always take this stuff seriously frameworks are everything in my opinion having a solid framework with abstract tools that you can basically just take and drop anywhere will make your life so much easier since you can basically just plug it into any project you start and just run with it,neutral

i was about to start making my first game my “dream game” glad i saw this and now i’m gonna get a few small games under my belt before my dream game,positive
i started my 2d platformer when i was just starting to learn unity and c i ended up taking a break to make a smaller game a 2d bullet hell shooter called hypershot i put it on steam and i still get a sale now and then now im almost finished my platformer which will be on steam next year,positive
hey glad to see this im about to start making my first game thomas always has the best advice,positive
tip 1 consider your hourly rate as a dev and its relation to your budget tip 2 dont make everything from scratch time is money tip 3 dont make your first game your dream game it should be your 15 minute crap game youll figure out your strengths tip 4 focus on prototyping its easier to build in pieces and funding will motivate you tip 5 build a community discord and social media,neutral
i wanted to make a 3d survival game with a massive map with multiple biomes weird animals diseases allergies and of course cut scenes once i drew the design on some paper i realized that i never had coded before so this would be way to hard now i watched this video and i think my first game will just be a simple platformer,neutral
these are some amazing tips and the one about not doing everything from scratch really made me realize how much time im wasting as for games i worked on a game for most of last year and now that i look back on it i made a lot of mistakes mostly related to planing but i did find out i am much better at programming and designing systems than actually making art plus i learned a lot about the type of games i am mostly good at making,positive
your tip about knowing your forte really resonated with me i too pride my self in character building and story telling those are my passions what keeps me making my game this being my first game you’re other tip was perfect i should make a small short game before putting my all into my dream story dream game this video hit at the perfect time for me and thank you for your content one question about your stories do you have them all laid out first before you start building your games or do you kind of build the story and the small details of the story as you go drawing inspiration from some of your worlds and art,positive
i did release my own game on ios about ten years ago it was the only personal project i ever released i outsourced all the creative assets just to save myself time crossing the finish line with this stuff is very challenging i totally agree making your crap game first is the way to go great video,positive
i really enjoy these tip type videos thomas they are really motivating i have my first smallsized project game in mind and it motivated me to not b afraid of using assets if needed thanks for being motivating proud to be part of the gamedev community,positive
cool video i always enjoy seeing game developer improvement over time keep going,positive
bro this is awesome keep up the good work man ik that your work will shine at one point,positive
keep up the good work,positive
awesome stuff,positive
cool video keep making the content its very fun to watch though it does keep me of from doing my homework oh and um… make a game for ios next s,positive
well done,positive
really good video it’s similar to mine but better lol,positive
thanks for the insight,positive
super underrated video and now i got inspired to make a gta clone too,positive
actually underrated,negative
cant wait until the game releases,positive
i love your videos and happened upon then through my recommended feed by showing all of your thought processes going into your designs and wealth of knowledge of architecture your passion made me want to support you and chef rpg through kickstarter i cant wait to see the final product and finally hop into the world you created ,positive
the game has a really nice identity im happy to contribute to it noah manages our project wonderfully and nikita impresses me since the beginning with his pixel art ,positive
i really like the path this game is going towards the world looks and feels alive yet captivatingly out of this world i would love to help you in a way english and turkish are my primary languages so you can reach to me if you need any translation work to turkish in the future since thats all i can do,positive
oooh it is so good to see the new inworld characters sprites also some of the latest decors look soo insane  you and clement did such a great job ,positive
the new character sprites look so good seems like you’ve come so far in such a short amount of time with the amount of detail and complexity in not only the art but the code i assumed you were a seasoned game designer and programmer when i saw your 1st devlog almost 2 years ago i was impressed then and even more so now watching chef rpg progress and improve as you continue to grow as an artist and game developer it’s not only fun but incredibly inspiration for the rest of us indie game dev i can’t wait for the next update,positive
the complexity throughout blows me away theres enough going on in a single indoor restaurant screen to make a fixed screen game out of that instead youre making a game with loads more to explore and do the amount of generosity it takes to make this much content is what i love most and is just as difficult to achieve as making a great game in the first place,positive
omg the new character sprites look fantastic the combination of someone with architectural experience a character artist and a sprite artist sounds very powerful,positive
love the thought that went to this games design and the improvments and overall progress you made thus far really glad i was able to back this project,positive
respect for all your hard work bro the game looks so amazing modern day art,positive
you guys should get a world wide credit for any improvements in the field of cse in upcoming years thank you for giving us these things for free,positive
im only two hours in and i feel like my brain is swelling and going to burst out of my eye sockets ears nose and mouth from all the pure knowledge youre giving me thank you this is the tutorial i was looking for youre actually teaching me the terms and functions and what they mean and not just teaching me how to copy text thank you,positive
this just shows how good youtube can be for teaching several one hour long lessons compressed into a single video for everyone to watch for free no matter where you are,positive
thank you so much this teacher is the best teacher from a tutorial ive ever had clear entertaining and easy to follow well done,positive
for beginners like me this is pure gold bb thanks for posting your vids,positive
i know its corona times but look at all the resources that are available for free what a time to be alive love it,positive
omg you dont know how thankful i am for this tutorial ive been trying to find a tutorial that explains every single thing in a line of code for me for so long thank you so much,positive
very good tutorial even if this tutorial is one year old id like to add something for the inheritance i think it wouldve been worth mentioning the protected accessibility level for variables for those that dont know a protected variable is the same as a private one except that the variable will be treated as if it was public for the child classes its pretty useful in cases like the one shown in this video,positive
7 hours of free content actually teaching you something and for free thank you,positive
i wanted to thank you so much for this tutorial im a total beginner and everything is explained so well and in a pleasant pace also im very thankful for the nice structuring of the video which really helps going back and finding the topics that you need easily thanks a lot for your effort it really is helpful,positive
fantastic game with seemingly endless potential other games in this genre feel outdated in comparison impressive for ea release,positive
3150 i really like the name sapiens that you landed on because that name isnt just prehistoric humans it is a game about sapiens it could be prehistoric medieval modern future or anything because of this you arent stuck with only cavemen it can go as far as you want and the modders want,positive
i’m addicted to this game you gave me the game i’ve wanted for years thank you ,positive
i discovered this project literally a few hours ago and now just minutes ago you upload a video discussing launch i have missed so much but i’m very much looking forward to release,positive
been playing this game for the last week and its brilliant id love to see some sort of interaction with rivers and the terraforming that can be used to create sapienmade canals and such looking forward to the future updates ,positive
your reaction to the release at the end with your family was so fucking wholesome congrats you are living the game dev dream,positive
10308 since we are talking about mines i wanted to ask you how you and the community feel about horizontal mines now i understand that the way that the terrain functions this is simply just impossible with your way of digging which is better for pit mines which i love because they leave a large impact on the world but it can be quite difficult to mine in very mountainy terrain as the slopes become too steep very often that is why i thought that perhaps we could have some sort of structure like a mineshaft entrance that would then allow your camera to get underground and for you to mine shafts with a line tool like how paths are made and hopefully fences in the future there could be various widths for technologies in the future like extra wide shafts for minecarts or tunnels with trains perhaps but that is far later into development you could also have parts that would allow you to make stair or ladder rooms to go up or down a level to make more compact or deeper mineshafts the way the terrain works currently actually really works with with that level system as when your dig out a secondary entrance it will be on a level already to match the tunnel networks a major issue with this though is how the camera system would work i could imagine a top down view working pretty well when building the tunnels however i feel like that might not fit the game i wouldnt have an issue with it but others may of course you can always do your standard 1st person view to walk around the mines if you want to but that wouldnt work when trying to make mineshafts i think edit i guess maybe you could still do your 1st person view if you could somehow make it look like you were actually underground and not just floating under the world and seeing through the ground another thing i thought of though is that this system would actually allow you to dig below sea level as all you would need to do is not render water underground i say that as if it is easy when i actually know hardly anything about game development but i do believe that should be achievable but going far underground would allow you to find metals that you normally wouldnt which i think would be cool of course it would probably be behind some kind of research that would allow you to brace your tunnels or something to prevent collapse,neutral
it’s been an amazing journey to follow absolutely crazy to think i was just 9 when you started work on this— congrats on the early access launch d,positive
been one heck of a ride watching this project for the past few years and finally seeing it come together youve made something really special and i wait to see where you go from here,positive
following the development of sapiens has been a lot of fun i hope the game continues beeeing developed for a long time and really well done making the game its amazing and pushing through past the honeymoon period of the development process,positive
hey everyone instead of the normal devlogs i put together this short summary of how i got into gamedev i hope this is interesting and if you havent already consider subscribing the next video will be a normal devlog again,positive
as a software engineer im doing everything the exact oposite way you are d the code being the easy part and graphics being the hard part you are really artistically talented love to follow your devlogs,positive
super inspiring im about a year and a half into my learning and it makes me feel a lot better about abandoning projects,positive
amazing how much history and experience goes into what looks like a relatively simple game you make it look so easy but it’s so much more than meets the eye,positive
6 years thats incredible loved hearing about how you started think its quite interesting to see how you love for drawingmodelling got you into making games,positive
thats awesome looks like it was a long journey but youve learned a lot im currently on about my 15th overlyambitious doomed project but i hope i can finish something decent soon,positive
i just want to appreciate the amount of effort youve put into making actual projects i often find myself just fiddling around with ideas in my head and not making any project myself i feel that has been a limiting factor in my learning but this video has been super inspirational i have been wanting to make my own devlog series but i was not able to stick to a project long enough till now i have been wanting to make devlogs and work on a small project for a timeline of 3 months and just finish a full game any tips to just stick to it,positive
absolutely loved seeing some of the old insect designs super cool stuff,positive
ive been struggling to get anywhere with my project im glad you havent given up and i love the asthetic and ideas you have for your current project dont give up,positive
your progress over the years is astounding this new game youve been working on looks amazing and is just the sort of game i would love to play i hope you keep at it,positive
 making a game watch this next how to design fun games  join our discord over 200 game developers  like the video to tell me you want a part 2,neutral
quite inspiring story i think most of us would be definitely interested in getting to hear a 2nd part of your journey,positive
as as a games student in my first year of college this has really inspired me to keep pushing myself keep it up mate,positive
congrats,positive
ive just started working at the game industry after studying gamedev too and its amazing that i can see myself in your story although i dont work for a aaa studio but time will tell,positive
im 40 years old just finally starting to getting round to learning programming and unity completely new to it but really enjoy watching these types of videos gives me more motivation ill probably never learn as much as you would have going to uni and stuff but its all fun and learning even if i just make some shitty 2d games thatll be cool haha,positive
ive been working in game dev for 45 years and it seems the best job offers comes not from hrs tech interviewers skill evaluations but the people that just understand what exact people they need in their team and just invite you over at least from my experience in east europe also when comparing your uk collegeuniversity experience to what we have in east europe you are in a intergalactic space age,positive
a friend recommended this video to me to inspire me to work harder on my course in level 3 games design from level 2 i figured itd be quite easy but damn i was mistaken this video has fully inspired me to push more and research more of my course so thank you for this 1 year journey it was very inspiring and keep it up,positive
amazing story makes me regret wasting so much time during collage when i knew i wanted to develop my game dev skills,positive
as a person who is still in school knows no coding language other than html and css very interested in game design favourite game being sea of thieves just mindblowing,positive
you still have clapped british teeth,negative
already 2 years of putting everything together it looks like a proper game good job,positive
wow it has been a journey good job on the 2 years of progress i reckon this game is going to a banger,positive
congratulations on 2 years of game dev awesome progress over the years,positive
man this is so exciting i can’t wait to see what this game will be about i’m also starting my game dev journey and you’re my motivation fuel keep grinding and i hope the best for your future,positive
its amazing how far this project has gone this is really a main inspiration for why i have picked up game development again,positive
i look forward to more game dev content,positive
this game is incredible good work ,positive
this really did have a vibe of a professional youtube video ive really enjoyed the editing style keep rockin in the free world,positive
keep it up bro youll blow up like this i love your humor and editing and also your story is so cool i am excited about your game,positive
along with 200 employees of course lol thats a really good point i just want to tell those who come up like hey so im basically making gta 5 in unity and ill release it on steam next week,positive

im doing ict in highschool and our teacher showed us this video in class i find game design very interesting and i wish to pursue it in the future i just wanted to thank you for making informative and entertaining content like this youre inspiring people to take up game making,positive
its so great to see you talk about game design i really think you should make a separate video about each one of those themes i see a lot of developers that know how to make games but dont really know how to make them fun and if you can teach them that youll be one step ahead of pretty much every channel like yours,positive
great video it may be overwhelming for someone just starting out but actually you are not saying that we have to be expert on all of these but mentioning important aspects of each for example the part of rules and the events in the game was great and even though it seems obvious i never thought about that i dont make games myself though but i find game making incredibly interesting and difficult,positive
thank you brackeys ive had so much trouble with designing my own games thanks for sharing your knowledge with everyone,positive
you give great tips and info that are worth so much more than the time you spend making them please keep up the great work and we will all keep watching,positive
the first game is wonder and so well polished imagine if it was released in 90s it wouldve wiped the market,positive
all these games seem pretty good but the first is definitely my favourite the second game looks nice enough however the gameplay looks rather bland,positive
the first game is awesome the second one just did what you wanted him to but nothing more the third one was quite cool but a bit boring also is horror game material the fourth game looked like if it was made by a 10 year old but still cool,positive
based on their fiverr pages the first game appears to have cost 25 the second 35 third 5 and last one is listed at 30 i would have to say 1 was easily the best investment,positive
the first game could end up being successful with proper funding and development i love the idea of the recoil that launches you imagine that they added bosses multiplayer etc,positive
the first one definitely felt more varied and had more to it compared to the others which they did do what they were requested but the other 3 just lookedgeneric in a way while the first had enemies with ai that would attack you interesting level design and the movement and gunplay had more personality to thembeing able to move the gun in any direction using recoil to jumplift off the ground as well as different types of guns to play with i guess it just had more polish to it compared to the others too,positive
the third game looks like it will change into an creepypasta type of game,neutral
what were the costs for each one thats very important the first one stands out a lot the others feel very dull,neutral
the developer of the first game is sick  great game,positive
the first game was a really clever reference to no time to explain with very similar mechanics and pretty much the same genre,positive

been in game development at least 14yrs now i literally lost track greatest advice given here is to target a niche and do something special platformers and zombie games are a dime a dozen pick out something unique thats cool maybe something that no one has done in many years thats how stardew valley blew up on steam,positive
tip 1 can’t be stressed enough i spent my first year learning courses on coursera and udemy thinking i’d get into game design once i’m “ready” that day never came no matter what i learned i never felt ready yet then one day i just started working on my project and said i’d learn new things where i needed to honestly doing things this way made me progress faster than any course ever has,positive
i have to agree there is no shame in having the docs open all the time memorizing everything isnt what gives you skill the important skill is knowing where to find the details when you need them,neutral
not sure if its mentioned in this video but something i feel should be said in every tips video like this dont do your dream project first you will ruin it if you dont give up first,negative
the tip i see missing from all of these videos is take inspiration from wide sources not just your favorite games whats the good in the game you otherwise hate what do you like about that book you just read how can you incorporate colour like they do in that movie you watched this is what they mean when they say good artists copy great artists steal when you steal something you make it your own and if you steal from a diverse set of inspirations it becomes truly yours,negative
you didnt waste those 2 years you learned so much you did so many things these things add up in the future we think we can learn everything in yt videos but experiencing it firsthand gives you a much deeper understanding of things,positive
shaders were super intimidating but i spent a weekend learning them and am so glad i did it i feel pretty fluent in them not even a week later and have been using them nonstop i needed to use them for one effect but the applications where shaders are useful keep appearing it’s definitely a tool worth having in your arsenal and like visual scripting vs actual coding being able to write your own shaders allows you to do performance things you wouldn’t be able to do with visual scripting a shader,positive
imo something thats extremely underrated especially for programmers is learning to use programming design patterns early on observer pattern is a must for game dev with larger projects having objects that fire events and other objects that subscribe to them is a much more sustainable way to do things than having a million references in each class to other objects and it makes your code more modular each classgame object is its own self contained thing singleton and factory patterns as well as solid principles are also good to look into factory less so for unity since you can use getcomponent to retrieve references for things if youre using unity learn to use unity eventsc events and you will make your code a lot cleaner and save time on large projects,positive
yes if you think you might want to add multiplayer coop you really should do it from the start suddenly you have to validate everything your players are saying they are doing along with replicating all the right properties without flooding the network and your animations and simulation has to be on point since players will be doing crazy things that ai just wouldnt we would give ai a pass on,neutral
i am still alive lol its going to take some more time but more devlogs will actually be coming also thanks for the crazy amount of support it means a lot,positive
ive watched this video a bunch of times it really is so good only just realised i wasnt subbed,positive
i would actually play this game for hours keep going,positive
actually i have a plenty good options for the game those options are player has 200 health points the turret has a field of view ai if it sees the player itll shoot health and power pickups airborne aerial targets such as drones heavy gunner drones scout drones etc ground targets such as beamshooting mechs enemy balls similar to the player but a little bit dumb and laser artilleries the tank can destroy the turret since the tank has the same weapons as the turret but it has significantly high damage on every shot from the tank grenadetype weapons and projectiles i meant by that which has new weapons to choose such as fullauto grenade launcher with a very low rate of fire or just a singleshot grenade launcher similar to the m79 the shield can spawn by using a shield powerup the player can shut down the turrets system i hope this guy would see this,positive
1011 that looks so fun even though the movement is basic id love to fight that,positive

this is one of the most inspiring videos ive ever watched thank you so much for this im new to the game design space and one of my biggest hurdles has been feeling overwhelmed about my lack of coding experience seeing your journey of how you went from no coding experience to being able to code a game by yourself at your first game jam really did something for me,positive
as a gamedev who uses construct 3 this is really inspiring,positive
this is lovely to hear how you found a whole community and amazing that you spent so long persistently making stuff especially over a year of daily art i just discovered core but didn’t realise it’s a creation tool i haven’t loaded it up yet and they described it more as an arcade full of games i’ve had an idea for a cat game for ages since i got three kittens last year and they’re hilarious i don’t suppose there’s a basic cat model to edit i draw and paint some but the oomph goes too easily i just got back into gaming after a while and you saying ‘i was a bored artist’ resonated i’ve been wanting to do more with characters i was writing a story for too heck i even learned code a few years ago but my passion for websites waned and i found i didn’t love battling all my errors enough to keep going so this all seems fun ,positive
the new dont explode looks so much better already even you have came a long way with pixel art and animation youre doing a great job ,positive
very inspiring for my own journey of learning unity so far ive been working on my own first project for 125 days,positive
your one of the best coders one youtube thanks for helping me on my journey,positive
ive been in it for 1 year and 3months back there i was crazy about game dev but getting far with learning i got lost tried a lot of technologies and because i was scared of not being able to get hired i got into javascript i dont have much knowledge here but react will be my main thing my heart is still in gamedev but it is very small amout of money in it and for living you need this money good luck to everyone reading my journey,neutral
hello i have been tremendously enjoying your devblog videos i can’t wait to see the next i do have a question how are you creating your buildings within your world i just started creating my own top down game with tilemaps and have encountered numerous issues creating buildings with tilemaps i noticed that in the beginning of this video you are making buildings with the tiles that looks like a different program are you having better success utilizing that method of creating your world,positive
i love the idea of this its a great way to see your progress when you usually dont see it,positive
how did you learn so much in this short time i am learning unity since last month and just know how to move my player in the x and z coordinate,neutral
cool  i hope you can do this full time someday,positive
awesome d,positive
nice video very inspiring and also handsome face,positive
this motivates me,positive
thanks so much for watchin guys and all your support ► remember you can get 40 off 3d art pro plus 2d art pro free,positive
ive experienced a fair amount of these mutations myself and i love the way you were able to convey your journey through the video i especially loved the bit about now youre the pizza guy the major trap is where i find my identity good stuff thomas keep it up,positive
i really appreciate thought process videos pressing buttons on the mouse and keyboard isnt the difficult thing getting into the right mindset is the real beast thanks for this,positive
thanks for sharing all this thomas its good to be aware of some of these pitfalls btw they also apply for things outside game development,positive
i absolutely love of how you show the dark side of gamedev too and not just make all theese videos about how to make your game great it always makes it more relatable and helps with motivation for me keep up the great work,positive
thanks thomas for being so transparent in your journey as a gamedev you level the playing field by showing us that the grass is not always greener on the other side you expose the struggles and show us encouraging ways to conquer the challenges along the way,positive
completely agree with your points in mutation 1 i am twice as good at codingdeveloping as i was last month and i have the urge to go back and fix things that i no longer deem worthy however i got to the point where i realized that just because i am better at in my craft doesnt mean that my old features are bad sometimes simplicity is key i think its about finding the right balance  thank you again for sharing your insights thomas ,positive
i found myself in several of those steps and i was already working on solutions for each of those well done thomas for putting those feelings into words so clearly,positive
dude i absolutely love the course and thanks for including the 2d art pro for free also thanks for being so inspiring and encouraging youve learned where the sweet spot is for making games and hit it every time you seek to educate thanks again,positive
the same goes for all the careers and fields there are always pros and cons a riskfree life is the most dull and boring life,negative

my dev friend asked me to write story for his game im so stoked ive been dying to get into writing for games were working on an indie game now and this video is everything i need,positive
i’m 35 and i love how when i was in high school it was thought of as impractical to become a game developer by most of our parents i remember being convinced that computer stuff is more of a hobby than something you can make a career out of and many of us believed them and decided to go to school for something else years later though some of us have finally decided to take the leap and make a career change for years i’ve wanted to learn how to code but i always thought i wasn’t smart enough to actually learn how so i never even tried until the end of last year now my only regret is that i didn’t start learning 20 years ago but i’ve learned so much is this past year keep developing and creating great stories my friend,neutral
not gonna lie i had tears in my eyes what a wonderful story subscribed,positive
im in the position starting out in film as well im very excited to embark on the game dev journey,positive
tip 26 make sure to like subscribe for more awesome game dev videos okayso maybe that was less of a tip and more of a suggestion,positive
454 totally agree with writing readable code i just dont think and are the problem at all in my opinion if someone sees that as hard to read they should probably take a step back i think badinconsistent indentation confusing variable names repeated code and organization in general are way greater problems that beginner coders do very often,negative
these were lessons i had to learn the hard way over my four years of development thanks for getting this crucial tips out there for people starting out,positive
my unofficial tip 26 comment your code it makes it so much easier to fix bugs or change things when you can see what pieces of code serve which purposes,positive
great vid on the controversial tip i agree keep your code readable but id argue this is more about naming properties and functions and not cramming too much on one line replacing variable with variable false leans towards being overly verbose to me i would read variable as not variable personally but whatever makes it easier for you to understand your own code when coming back to it,positive
a big tip i have to give programmers is to avoid micro optimizations as a coder its generally very easy for me to sometimes fall into a pitfall of seeing a piece of my code and trying to optimize it into oblivion if you have fun then power to you coding is a hobby after all but if youre just doing it to save those precious 2ms its not worth it by any means you can do so much better stuff with your time than spending a couple hours optimizing a system for a negligible boost in efficiency,neutral
my reflexive advice for someone thats picking between art styles is err on the side of what you can crank out because you can more reliably finish that,neutral
on that readable code tip 24 id refine that to say make sure you can read your own code in a game im currently working on ive added some variables that i could very easily get away without using the only reason i have them is because they make my code cleaner and easier to work with also make sure you can understand your own code and follow exactly what it does line by line it is a good idea to create some model or system to define how your code will work and stick to that model unless an adjustment is absolutely necessary to that end i will create empty methods if thats how my model works,positive
507 never ever do this if boolean false is horrible form if an exclamation mark is really too difficult then just use the not keyword but please dont abuse comparison operators like that,negative
these are great im working on my ansi ascii roguelike and i keep getting caught up in tiny details like changing the color of the player and enemies when theyre frozen or poisoned and tweaking the ui,positive
start your free trial on gamemaker studio 2 here thank you guys for watching the video,positive
the fact that the second game developer was paid less than minimum wage is upsetting none of the artists were credited as well such a shame,negative
the first game felt like a flash game the second felt like a full release and the third felt like one of those unity games with fun physics overall the thumbnail was not only clickbait but those 3 poor devs were definitely heavily underpaid for their work i dont think i would be happy only giving them so little money for their work and not even giving them credit either,negative
as a developer on fiverr i think all 3 but especially the last 2 shouldve gotten paid way more this takes at least a couple hours to build even for an experienced developer and fiverr takes 20 of all your revenue thats not even half of minimum wage,neutral
thumbs up for the developers in your video thumbs down for you not giving them the exposure they deserve,neutral
i feel really sorry for whomever made the second game they sold themselves short i mean you dont owe it to the developer but it would be really cool if your worked with them to make it a full release if theyre interested also could you give these devs a shout out,neutral
i really really hope this gets backlash those devs deserved to be at least credited,neutral
second one was definitely the best honestly with a few updates to design ui and the background this could be a top tier mobile game the background could change to a crystal cavern at a higher lvl and the enemies could change later lvls,positive
give each of the devs 10 of the earnings by this video as bonus you still get to keep 70 for the work they did without even getting credit for their work,neutral
the third game would have been a lot more interesting with one change the platforms are hexagons much smaller and with several more of them on screen at once so that youre always in danger of falling into a hole and not exactly sure where the path is going furthermore after reading several other comments i agree about crediting the developers however everyone needs to realise that the prices were agreed upon before development and the prices were integral to the experiment if the developers were not ok with the amounts they were paid then they wouldnt have accepted the job,neutral
opening blender for the first time is terrifying wheres the make finished 3d model button,negative
when your game turned pink after the render pipeline switch that was supposed to happen it seemed like you had forgotten to change all of the materials to the new rp materials it should be somewhere in edit inside the rendering urp convert all materials sorry if im wrong though good video,neutral
i actually loled a few times watching this you perfectly described a persons first experiences with game dev and unity pretty well most peoples are worse than your experience because they have no programming experience and dont understand anything going on at all ,negative
you are very underrated your editing and game development skills are amazing when i watched ur video i have not looked at ur sub count and ii honestly though o was watching a channel that had over 100k subs if u keep this up you will get to 1 million subs in no time,positive
thats prob the best dev log i ever seen  i see so much effort put into just one video like this one ,positive
you really know how to edit and create games hope you continue youtube you are very under rated,positive
congrats man you are going places great editing and content got a new subscriber ,positive
underrated youtuber i really like this editing style and it never gets boring,positive
hahaha great stuff i lost it when you coded coroutine for the enemy death instead of doing it properly which is not that hard such a nice workaround good job d,positive
you have probably learned this by now but in your animator on unity you can make an event somewhere in the animation so when you reach a certain point in the animation you can trigger a function im not very good at english hope you understood me,neutral

448 im an unreal dev and the way i see engines is that they are tools pick the one that suit your needs and stick to it even change them if you need to i dont understand the war between unity and unreal i chose unreal because my favorite game gears of war was made in using it and also i saw a timelapse of a guy creating a stellar scene in unreal plus unreal was more shiny looking so my dumb ass just went with it,neutral
when copypasting code its important to know what youre writing try to understand what each line does it helps troubleshooting and learning,neutral
for all the new indie devs use which ever game engine you feel comfortable with unity godot gamemaker and yes unreal be persistent and make lots of games can make your dream game or side project,positive
freecheaper alternatives krita instead of ps blender default one affinity or inkscape for vector art asprtie for pixel art,neutral
i use unity every day and its great its like an allrounder game engine unreal is more of a 3d artistfocused engine so choose unity if youre more of a programmer and want to make crossplatform and various games choose unreal if you only want to make 3d games and youre more of an artist if youre still not sure just go with unity,positive
ive only worked in unity once to do a codealong game that brackey did a series on but i plan on learning both so i can choose whichever suits my needs better i feel like both have their pros and cons from the sound of it,neutral
hi thomas brush im brad fry and i work as a self employed flooring and installer and want to make games for a living haha your intro inspired me to write that but all jokes aside im 37 and have 4 kids and my own business well solo contractor your videos have really given me the feeling i could at least learn to develop games despite the limited time keep up the good work,positive

when i was 14 and thought of developing my own game i was so overwhelmed by the code i ended up quitting you are so talented i’m gonna stick to playing video games lmao,positive
the fact you even thought the robot saw himself as the hero for fighting pollution is really mesmerizing probably a kind of game id be interested if released on steam great evolution in your projects btw,positive
great job accomplishing so much when you were so young its great to see how many different genres you tried too would love to see what you are working on currently,positive
wow most of your games can be combined into one huge game just imagine a bunny shooting while on top on a plane,positive

dude its amazing how much you were able to balance so many things in your daily life i envy it,positive

this dude has a dream setup but then a family reunion lawn chair thats the definition of i can do what i want,positive
yo this video has gotten a lot more views than it deserves for being as dumb and badly put together as it was so i feel like i should clear a few things up first off to game devs who are just starting out dont attempt to do exactly what i did because it probably wont work out well and im not saying this because i think im smarter or better at game dev than you in all honesty im pretty average and tons of people couldve done a lot better in my shoes but thats just the thing not everyone is in my shoes and has the same experience that i had prior to this id been making 2d games and was quite familiar with coding so carrying that over to unity and 3 dimensions was fairly simple i mentioned this in the video but ive seen too many comments in the vein of wow this was impressive i would never be able to do this which frankly makes me feel a little bad since most people probably would be able to do this if they had the same experience i had and i dont want to discourage anyone who doesnt realize this so i just wanted to reiterate that this was just a video made for shits and giggles by a guy who already knew how to make 2d games and wanted to apply that knowledge to 3 dimensions also everyone learns at their own pace in their own way and the rate at which that gets done doesnt really matter as long as youre able to learn what you needed to learn in the end within reason of course if it takes 8 years to figure out how to print hello world then we might have a problem so even if you have as much experience as i did there should be no reason to feel bad if you take more time because ultimately it doesnt really matter how quickly youre able to learn how to make games as a game developer you develop games and the quality of those games is really the only thing you should be worrying about not how quickly you can make them of course this mostly only applies if youre doing this as a hobby and if you have a deadline to meet and bills to pay you should probably worry a little more and on the other side of the spectrum to those who think this video was faked it wasnt lol as mentioned before i already knew how to make 2d games and how to program things arguably the hardest part of developing games because of that the focus of this video wasnt on that but rather applying what i knew to 3d games by learning 3d modelling animation and how to work with unity which was fairly easy and straightforward thanks to the massive amounts of documentation and resources available on the internet and such but mostly this was just for shits and giggles since i find messing around with 3d games entertaining and i feel like people may be reading into it too much lol also there are a few continuity errors that a few people have caught in the dates shown on my computers taskbar but that was caused by how i usually record clips while video editing and not when im actually making the games so i just have a weird workflow and last thing to youtube why the fuck does this have 500000 views did the algorithm break i can think of a whole lot of videos that deserve 500000 views and this is definitely not one of them so if youre watching this go watch someone elses video or something this one has way too many views already,negative

the first talk was great solo developers can get caught up following professional project management methods but forget the factor of individual motivation eg it might be faster to first deal with the most complex problem but making small wins working on art or marketing along the way helps you to stay motivated,positive
was amazing to be involved in this hopefully you all can get some good nuggets out of it along with being more prepared for the hidden pitfalls,positive
the talks were good but their personal reflections were amazing we really put these guys on a pedestal but we tend to ignore the emotional impact of solo development the gratification when the project is finished is amazing but the journey there definitely seems like a rollercoaster,positive
4624 this is actually insanely important and probably underrated advice there was a time in my life where i ended up stifling all of my random ideas in the name of higher priorities and it unwittingly spiraled me into 23 years of burnout and depression this is all in retrospect because at the time i thought i was doing the right thing but its extremely clear to me now that you need to give yourself the freedom to create and explore eventually youll find the balance of how much time you should set aside for those tangents and sometimes those tangents turn out to be a core part of your final work sometimes they turn out to be nothing too but dont be discouraged just have fun overall i loved all of these speakers really excellent session,neutral
independent developers should bookmark this cursed problems in game design also hosted by gdc 2 of the best imo,positive
the common refrain is to use temp assets to prototype gameplay and systems so that you dont waste time remaking assets if systems demand it it sounds like for solo devs accepting that risk is worth the boost in confidence that having art first grants,neutral
i had my second project planned before releasing the first game which helped me skip that depressing stage after releasing theres really no happiness at the end of the road no matter how many sales you make so gotta enjoy the adventure and hop on the next one right away,positive
such a great and relevant session each of the panelists had a ton of valuable insights to offer thank you,positive
im absolutely stunned how much emotional i got with this speeches kind of like in the last public question im also doing a board game and im happy to hear that games take extremely long to port and that it is a rollercoaster of emotions and full of pitfalls to watch out for but as long as i keep looking back at my younger self who started my streamers ace project i cant make him sad and quit thanks for that amazing talk and all your effort you all put into it,positive
i love how they all highlight different spectrum of solo development,positive
i have to ask how do you line up the monitor camera transitions so well xd is it really just holding the camera precariously at an angle that lines up the monitor bezels and then moving it out so well done,positive
as a dev i liked that small insight into the code and class implementations would be up to see more of that in future,positive
you motivated me to start being more orderly to have plants and to eat healthier i really like your routine and im trying to improve mine as well soon i will also enter patreot i really appreciate what you are doing,positive
i love these calm relaxing devlogs keep it up dd,positive
i feel like enjoying your healthy daily routine more than the coding part xd i like how you mix designing modeling coding and life style content in your dev logs great content,positive
your videos are such a treat to watch always excited when a new one is posted keep up the good work the game is really coming along nicely,positive
this game feels way better to me now that youve chilled out the tool usage a really good and subtle change to the vibe,positive
your meals look divine  the game is progressing nicely,positive
idea you could have the pathways act as ‘barriers’ making it harder or impossible for weeds to spread thus giving you a reason to separate farm plots and giving the path tiles a function,neutral
great update love your focus on the little details that ensure this game will be a relaxing experience for players on an unrelated note i look forward to the day when i can eat dinner without my puppy needing to go in the crate p,positive
bro i am so glad i discovered your channel these videos are gem not only entertaining but they also highly motivate me to start with unreal engine thanks,positive
damn next time i wanne be the one to test out your epic games ,neutral
every single game has to have an assault rifle tf2 i have no such weakness,neutral
your channel is such an inspiration to us slow methodical developers struggling to finish overcomplicated projects to try new things,positive
wow you have 6 videos and managed to gain over 100k subscribers that is truly impressive and shows how good your content is,positive
i would love a multiplayer classic doom type of game that would be dope,positive
it was quite funny bro loved it also got some level design ideas for my very first game thank you so much,positive
hell yeah dude although i would recommend it gets exposure and be free for sometime the reason is well you re a small dev and you gotta gain a following and give good feedback to your customers and its an initial experimental stage,positive
if you ever want to release this please make the shotgun range realistic,neutral
hey just wondering did you use the default sessions for the multiplayer or some other plugin would be handy to know because the default sessions i think are only lan and loopback and ive tried that steam plugin but that doesnt work out great also good video,negative
go to and use code hmw to get 15 off clickups massive unlimited plan for a year start reclaiming your time for less than 5 a month hurry offer ends soon,positive
microtransactions are really soiling the gaming experience imo everything is quickly becoming a subscription,negative
save you 14 minutes games as a service are vastly more profitable than the initial revenue from games,positive
the reason triple aaa games are becoming so expensive and some are totally failing is just because they focus on tech and not on design theyre treating what were supposed to be enjoyable games as engine demos and not giving enough time to release them properly you cant just create another gta v every single year that shit takes a lot of time,negative
another issue is that whenever you sink that much money into a single project the designers have to give up a significant amount of creative control business just wont allow that much money to be spent on an experiment everything ends up being the old tried and true so you end up with very samey uncreative bland games that look really nice,negative
when some people say games from older generations were better i must agree as a kid i imagined how insane the games would look like with so much more options to buy and play with even better graphics and physics but sadly nowadays most titles are just cash grabs and the fun part is ignored its hard to find triple a titles with good and fun gameplay without only pay2win features thats why im revisiting emulation indie games and a few aaa titles which are worth the money and also the playtime,positive
ive been telling my friends this for the past couple years we are going to see fewer aaa games because games not only have to compete with other new releases but all of the preexisting games as well there is just so much competition in this industry,negative
here is my issue with this aaa game companies are trying too hard to make the biggest game big being best graphics biggest worlds widest variety be in customization weapons vehicles etc which will need lots of people and technology naturally which i could excuse that for big game companies withholding new projects except when you have games like undertale minecraft before microsofts purchase goosegame goat simulator powerwash simulator etc getting loads and loads of sales when theyre developed by small teams these games are very basic graphically have a very short play time minecraft an exception no big budget no fancy effects no extraordinary acting but just simple fun heck id be willing to consider undertale a masterpiece and its a very short game players dont want big they want good yes the newer games look pretty but i promise best graphics isnt necessarily what gamers are aftee best graphics should be icing on the cake not the whole cake,neutral
fair to say the golden age of gaming is truly gonesad reallybut glad i grew up gaming in the 90s and early 2000ssad a lotta kids wont experience the magic we did,neutral
it’s awful sad to see how stuff goes to thrash when the general public gets access look at youtube itself with its mandatory “ad friendly content” social media taking over everything lack of variety due to companies milking “winning formulas” dry game companies noticing that the casual player is not demanding quality at all… it sucks,negative
i remember freshman year when you would be working on your games in class cool to see how far you’ve come with it,positive
glad to have found your channel this gives me a lot of insight im kinda feeling the i dont even like animating thing right now and wondering wtf else i can put those skills towards,neutral
i hope one day to be able to look back at your progress as greatly as you have been able super hyped for the release,positive
the journey from not understanding what an if statement is to having a complete game is always awe inspiring to look back on hopefully well see some cool projects in unreal engine at somepoint,positive
great video its awesome how far youve come and to see such a positive attitude with game dev keeping things realistic is always best,positive
great vid man was nice to see how your game dev journey began good luck on the next project,positive
even though i just got a recommendation from this channel i am proud of your pursuit for your passions,positive
super happy to see how far you’ve come being your friend getting to come over and see your progress has always been so much fun can’t wait to keep seeing your progress,positive
just keep trying to improve everyday words to live by,positive
hey i recently discovered your channel and i just wanna say im practicing many things that i am passionate about and your channel is a big inspiration just hope you know youre making good influences,positive
entertaining video man 618 tho ,neutral
dude the algorithm has blessed me with this wonderful video 1010 you earned a new sub,positive
woah ive never met somebody so underrated your sense of humour is immaculate mixed with politeness and a good amount of jokes the way you explain everything so crisply and manage to fit it all in in just a 10minute long video is surprising keep up the good content o,positive
dani is literally the reason ive started game dev he might not realize this but hes inspired alot of people including me and karlson is literally my dream gamemainly because i grew up playing mirrors edge and other parkour games,positive
underrated i agree he’s extremely good at game development but he also has millions of subscribers millions more viewers and two of his later games both got incredibly well received and took the front page of steam by storm not to mention karlson is incredibly anticipated by millions and one of the most wishlisted games on steam many other solo gamedevs out there who pour just as much if not more time and effort into making games just as good could not dream of that someone who likely everyone who clicked on this video already knows is not what i’d call underrated there are plenty of smaller game devs who are overshadowed by the more well known ones like dani i’m not saying it’s his fault or anything i watch him and support him i’m just saying the claim that he’s underrated let alone the most underrated is incredibly wrong as far as i’m concerned,positive
he ain’t overrated not underrated he’s a extremely brilliant developer who is wellrated,positive
at first i thought this was going to be a bad retelling of danis history video but instead it talked about things after that and indepth telling of crab game and muck that was pretty entertaining keep doing what youre doing in a few years you will with no doubt have 1 million if you keep it up,positive
dani def isn’t the most underrated game dev he has millions of subs 2 front page steam games and so many people know who he is,neutral
good video wouldnt agree with the title though since well hes one of the most popular indie devs out there with an audience of over 3 million on youtube and the 2 free games he put on steam being orders of magnitude bigger than even successful games but hey titles are titles it didnt really get driven on particularly much in the video,positive
such amazing content creator definitely needs more support you earned a subscriber hoping for more nice content,positive
that desk would’ve taken me at least 3 days to draw,negative
this is one of my fav videos from you lately i loved seeing more of your late development process i’ll be building my gaming pc soon aswell so i’m really hype for the launch of “monster tower” lmao,positive
nice video reece im always impressed by the cool and unique videos ideas you think of,positive
this game looks fkng great i love those kinds of games like go and explore by yourself no one will stop u and says hey go here and here,positive
awesome way to beat procrastination d im barely even keeping a todo list with my current project i have a list with 5 tasks 3 are done lol hopefully this will inspire me to be more organized because it will speed up my development 200 youve inspired me as always reece and ive only been awake 15 mins d,positive
hey reece this is a really cool and unique video idea and great execution love the insights and entertainment i got here since i could also totally relate to all the time consuming tasks of game dev usually i calculate for everything 23x the time i write down because it usually takes longer and unexpected things start to happen always,positive
the part of estimating the time needed reminds me of the agile development method of estimating so called story points to tasks to put them in relation to each other compared to the size and complexity,neutral
that was anticlimactic love the video though great idea to challenge yourself and get yourself motivated again,positive
its so hard not to crunch during game dev big ups for this,positive
the game is looking great really interesting challenge too since you drew i suggest a rematch to find a true winner,positive
im just finishing up a computer science degree and i really want to get into video game development i play indie games almost constantly and i love the idea of making something of my own that i myself and other people can enjoy but i keep holding myself back because im scared and dont know where to start this video was definitely helpful and inspiring to me and it makes me feel like i actually have a shot at gaining the skills i need and making something cool,positive
hi great video really gave some helpful insights im currently in university studying computer science as every single company in my city said its a requirement but im also going to be working on my own projects hopefully i can skip the stage of being employed and start my own company we can dream haha but yeah this has been helpful the information was concise and well presented good job and thank you,positive
my dream since i was like 12 is to work for rockstar i hope i get there one day,positive
i was considering about joining a coding bootcamp program for possible game dev applications and job fittings afterwards most bootcamps i have come across are primarily web development for tech companies and job placement with companies like google apple etc are there any game dev bootcamps similar to those do they have a high percentage hire rate within so many months after completing their program,neutral
these videos are really helpful i watch them with my friends on voicely whenever we practice coding we all agree that we learned more from youtube videos than from school lol,positive
bro i just learned that the college im planning on attending next year also has japanese courses which ive wanted to do since middle school combining that with game development could lead me to working for a japanese developer like fromsoftware,positive
i like the nods to fanboyism in this presentation  i was unlucky that in my college years you generally only had 1 option in it which were basically programming for databases and networking while i specifically went to learn coding and graphics designing to create games i learned the graphics part on my own also because i had a real knack and passion for it coding was more difficult as information to code for gaming or even a gameengine were hard to come by or expensive now almost 2 decades further our country finally is getting a gamingindustry and there are classes you can follow i hope i can start in september and hopefully theyre not too basic as i already have some basics i already tried creating a game twice sort of first time was more than a decade ago supposed to be a fighting game or beatem up i got my character modelled not textured and even rigged for facial animation but i soon realized that coding and balancing a fighting game is really hard to do so much to consider and take into account and there wasnt even a decent free engine that could provide what i needed two years ago i started again but with another genre i liked and more manageable for a single game dev an arcade racer luckily i was able to pick up blender easily where i left of they also made it more userfriendly and found a decent free gameengine godot atleast good enough to give me the taste of gamecreation and create a tiny concept i have some videos on my gamedev channel close call racingon channel eyeemotion i have been on a break from it because of renovations at home which i have to execute myself and im changing to unreal engine since its change in licensing and its more friendly to devs who are more into designing than programming i just need that gamedev 1 year course to get the ball rolling again and keep me motivated when i get stuck and the information i need,neutral
thanks to ricch dawg for being there for me when i truly needed strong support you made this degree happen for me by arranging digit credit card info for me to be able to do the payment have been struggling for ,positive
i was thinking about becoming a game developer who primarily creates code as a hobby i dont like the art side of it i figure i would rather download sprites from websites and use those for a 2d indie game i am learning javascript and i was thinking about using threejs and javascript for creating a nice small 2d game maybe for mobile and importing it to reactnative i am guessing this will take me another 4 months of learning javascript before i am able to program my first small game i am learning javascript for web development but i think i will at the end pivot into mobile development,neutral
hi there this was a great video that has told me exactly what i need to know could you recommend some groupscommunities that accept someone with no experience at all i have a physical version of my game and i know the rules inside and out i have learnt how to draw digitally and am transferring the art into a format that can be used in the game i want to make and a community that is welcoming and that gives feedbackadvie would be awesome,positive

unity oh lets sponsor this guy he makes games in our engine n8dev i made my own game engine,neutral
pretty brave of unity to sponsor their 1 competitor great stuff,positive
just imagine how cool a game engine jam would be,positive
really like the editing can def tell a lot of effort was put in,positive
editing is on point with this one but unitys taking a huge risk sponsoring its competitor,neutral
the simple idea of making a game engine from scratch is just too impressive for my tiny brain to comprehend,positive
can’t help but notice n8 is only 2k away from 10k… i’m referring to the fact that you should subscribe,neutral
yo this video is so good my guy i love how you used after effects for the entire editing process but for real incredible work glad to have my face featured also ,positive

maybe he could have a pet wolf with a revolver in its mouth that follows him around and when you right click the wolf shoots in that direction and can hit an enemy,neutral
babe quick milkmansteve just uploaded,neutral
you could give him a revolver that shoots but in a limited range similar to the swords range cool video btw,positive
i feel like the older model could still work fine if you made him look more closely to a blob around the face area and just had a bigger emphasis around the face,positive
cant wait to see how it turns out looks sick so far  ,positive
look into how nuclear throne does attack animations it simply teleports the sword from one side of the player to the other while creating a separate slash object which slowly dissipates i’ve used this technique in my current roguelike and it works amazingly well,positive
sword have the sword be static on his back or in a side holster then animating attacks that way possibly do both gun floating revolver controlled via mouse shoot with left click and can do a charged shot with right click going this route could make the game too easy though sword and gun do a side holster sword as mentioned above and have a revolver mentioned above that charges with the damage done to the boss edit remember i am smooth brained so may not be good ideas,neutral
i’ve always wanted to make a game and i’ve come up with many ideas for it but i’ve never been committed enough to actually learn game development glad to see you pulling through and learning it keep up the great work also what if for a 2 hit floating sword combo you swing it overhead for the first hit and for the second attack the sword flings out and spins in a circle,positive
i always tend to make my main characters cute and small it makes it easier for the players to get attached to them so as far as audience feedback goes at least one dude likes the new design as for animations with floating hands most of my characters have floating hands like yours but mainly use ranged weapons limited pixel count makes melee combat hard to pull off so dont be too hard on yourself if you have a hard time making it if youre not too attached to the melee combat why not focus on ranged instead kinda like cuphead focuses on ranged and has melee on the side,positive
my name is len thanks for building an island for me,positive
the artwork looks absolutely fantastic that is a huuuge selling point for a game like this people that like really chill games will love that if the dungeons are cool enough for players who like a good diablo grind youll have a game that appeals to a huge variety of players,positive
yoo thanks for this it teaches soo much im a noob and have a dream and idea of eventually creating my own game if it takes me 10yrs and only my friends play it doesnt matter i will do it,positive
hi julian i love your game so far and am obsessed with the art style of it all i am from california with a bachelors degree in english and wanted to see if you needed a writer to develop the world lore or whatever storycampaignquestsdialogue you want to bring into lens island i dont have a portfolio since i am just starting to reach out to developers for my first opportunity to write for someone but would love to connect to maybe write a test piece for you and if you like it then we could look into working together i will write anything and everything for your game free for a full year and will sign an nda to protect your work either way i wish you all the best and thank you for your time logan,positive
“i’m not a game designer i do have a degree in game design”,neutral
when you cant find a game that has everything you want you make it yourself lol,neutral
been following this project for ages and im always blown away by the attention to detail in the level design super excited to see where the game goes from here,positive
seems like a pretty large scope to launch this december,positive
the game is looking awesome when i first saw your videos about your studentprojectgame and your new project it motivated me to work harder and now i am in gamedesign school myself thank you a lot for the motivation however i think it might be good to add some impact to trees and rocks when hit like a little shake as of right now the only indication you hit the rocktree is the popup text and that is not really satisfying not that its bad the way it is right now just as feedback,positive
its so aesthetic definitely my favourite aspect is the versatility one has when playing if one didnt want to dungeon crawl they could create amazing buildings etc and vice versa,positive
ive listed the links to all the free software mentioned in the video ill be updating it frequently with your recommendations as well make sure the check out the description for the full list,neutral
love the video goodgis having used bfxr in the past im gonna check out labchirp now xd here are a few i didnt see in the video but i think are worth a mention graphicsgale pixel art krita foss raster art sunvox music tracker petaporon simple piano roll sequencer famistudio chiptune music famitracker chiptune music tracker chiptone sound effects,positive
the one thing i think you really missed here in the raster editing section is krita which is especially useful for creating tiling textures as well as having a really powerful painting workflow,positive
for 2d art i personally use krita its free and pretty neat its good with animation too,positive
adding this to my learn how to gamedev playlist,neutral
really well put together video loved the editing as always and i feel that the topic you picked up on today is one that not many people do touch upon but is incredibly essential i know ive been developing games for over 3 years now and over one year with unity really important topic and you grabbed it and gave a perfect video as always good job ps almost to 30k,positive
i would just like to say that audio software wise you have saved me so much research thank you for making this video and keep up the great work,positive
i know that you cant get into it in a short video but the political philosophy behind foss is fascinating in many ways foss or at least its driving philosophies predate proprietary software,positive
other alts raster krita it also kind of supports vector music lmms,neutral
247 actually all unity tools are available in the free version you only need to pay when you exceed 100000 dollars per year there are no limits,positive

press m to merge two or more points in blender its rly useful also nice vid d,positive
quick idea the player is able to construct a mastership between islands with customizable elements that shehe can bring back from exploration,neutral
i got a cool idea maybe have space pirate raids on your ship in order to keep track of them you would need to use your ships cameras to see where they are heading possibly trying to cut off specific parts of the ship with doors in order to allow you to get there in time to take them out if there is combat they could probably take a couple slots per chest if they get to it then retreat to their ship maybe its always flying next to your ship while you are being raided this could make flying through the world pretty dangerous as at any point pirates could come and raid you maybe there could be a whole security system that enemies have to get passed or maybe they could cut your power in half making you unable to escape until all are gone it could really make the game incredibly fun,neutral
this is awesome ive been working on mine for nearly two years now its crazy difficult to keep motivated but i always found myself coming back to get work done my game releases next month and i cant wait youve been doing it longer though i respect you for the sheer amount of motivation youve had to keep up and for starting a project this big,positive
this game has come a very long way and is looking amazing good job so far me too is working on a 3d survival game and it is quite fun,positive
those models look great i love the style also a fan of the editing,positive
this looks awesome man i love your idea of being able to make your base mobile and fly your terrain designs and creatures are also very cool keep up the good work and thanks for the video,positive
the progress is looking super awesome and impressive also spending 3 years behind a single project shows dedication really like the features that you showed here especially where the one where the base starts flying for the enemies a b and c i actually like all of them you could use all three and give different functionality to them like one of them are predator and hunts the other two and the player 045 you could use blenders merge by distance to merge the vertex i just enable this by default and give the lowest distance value and blender just merges vertex automatically if they are too close like in your one saves lot of time keep it up,positive
the game looks great i love the models also the video editing skills are great d i wish i could make even one 3d model lol x i subscribed,positive
its really bold of you to ditch the safety of your masters degree to pursue your indie dev career truly inspiring and thanks for sharing your stats i hope more indie devs do their sales overview it helps aspiring game devs like me to gauge whats realistic and whats not when it comes to running a oneman studio,positive
dude thats awesome also making a game every 3 months aint so bad youre officially in the business now i cant wait to one day join the rest of you,positive
1 to engagement metrics also after a year of it being up it would be cool to do a follow up video to see the life span of the game,positive
i appreciate you explaining the logistics of game development it simply is something done out of passion,positive
i usually dont leave good comments but youre a pretty funny guy good personality and its a shame that somebody so smart made very little on a really cool game like that i hope it becomes much more successful shout out to all the underdog nerds out there who dont get what they truly deserve,positive
the video was engaging and entertaining i think continuing this level of quality regardless of topic is probably gonna get your channel to some serious viewership in the future you seriously deserve more subs than what you have just keep doing what you’re doing thanks for the video,positive
dude thats awesome its a lot of money dont knock yourself down over it its nice seeing a small indie dev become successful,positive
the amount of hardwork you put in your video i cant say you are amazing,positive
i love how transparent and motivating you are keep it up im supporting u ,positive

you should add a playground for the seekers while they wait to be released a mini jungle gym or something like that so they wont be bored while waiting the 30 seconds,neutral
a couple suggestions that might be fun to see in game ropes that you can swing on would be a welcome addition to diversify gameplay i think a small fireball would be a cool rock skin to put in the game as well you can recolor it 5 different times to milk it as much as possible im very exited to see this games future so good luck,positive
you should add a taunt ability for the hiders that plays a monkey sound the seekers can hear it the hiders can taunt manually but every 2 mins it automatically taunts because it is still really easy to hide from the seekers,neutral
an idea for the rock skins maybe you can make them the gemstones in the cave and make them unlockable by interacting with the gemstones down there sounds pretty neat,positive
218 to be honest man this was actually pretty good it has a nice friendly yet also slightly cursed in a good way feeling to it,positive
personally i think adding a way for the seekers to set bananas as traps that would show the location of a hider that triggers it might be cool,positive
i have a suggestion for a mechanic that can be easily implemented into this game in a potential update i suggest making the cannons functional allowing the hides and the seekers to launch themselves across the map using the cannons,neutral
suggestion maybe instead of giving away the locations of the hiders after a period why not force to hiders to make monkey noises instead,neutral
you should make an button in controls setings go crazy that randomizes your controls dont forget the reset controls too,neutral

summary machine learning is the general term for when computers learn from data there are lots of different ways algorithms that machines can learn the algorithms can be grouped into supervised unsupervised and reinforcement algorithms the data that you feed to a machine learning algorithm can be inputoutput pairs or just inputs supervised learning algorithms require inputoutput pairs ie they require the output unsupervised learning requires only the input data not the outputs here is how in general supervised algorithms work you feed it an example input then the associated output you repeat the above step many many times eventually the algorithm picks up a pattern between the inputs and outputs now you can feed it a brand new input and it will predict the output for you here is how in general unsupervised algorithms work you feed it an example input without the associated output you repeat the above step many times eventually the algorithm clusters your inputs into groups now you can feed it a brand new input and the algorithm will predict which cluster it belongs with the first example in this video used the knearest neighbor algorithm which is a supervised machine learning algorithm hope that was useful to someone thanks for the video really enjoyed it,neutral
scenario 1 facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs explanation it is supervised learning here facebook is using tagged photos to recognize the person therefore the tagged photos become the labels of the pictures and we know that when the machine is learning from labeled data it is supervised learning scenario 2 recommending new songs based on someone’s past music choices explanation it is supervised learning the model is training a classifier on preexisting labels genres of songs this is what netflix pandora and spotify do all the time they collect the songsmovies that you like already evaluate the features based on your likesdislikes and then recommend new moviessongs based on similar features scenario 3 analyze bank data for suspiciouslooking transactions and flag the fraud transactions explanation it is unsupervised learning in this case the suspicious transactions are not defined hence there are no labels of fraud and not fraud the model tries to identify outliers by looking at anomalous transactions and flags them as fraud,neutral
wonderful and fantastic tutorial its really helpful the explanation is so clear thumb up to the tutor,positive

i love these videos i just had a tech exec at a fortune 200 company ask me for any podcasts that could help him stay abreast of currentemerging technology i didnt have a great answer for him but i did mention this series he was looking for more audiocentric content though food for thought ibm technology,positive
so i do like this series but this confused me because he switched from one output should i buy pizza to another output is this a pizza or a taco is this a fundamental difference in what dl vs ml is able to do or that the first output doesnt require as many layers to become a neural network so therefore would always sit at a dl level sorry i think i need to do more study and come back to this video,neutral
funfilled tech bites loved it,positive
i dont completely agree on deep learning explanation because for weight training labelling is required yes patternfeature extraction can be debated but labelled data is required,negative

one “like” is not enough for the work that has gone into making one such video this video should be part of the curriculum and he should get the royalty for this awesome work,positive
this video kickstarted my journey in ml a year back trust me back then i watched this video three times to finally understand it might be challenging for few to get it but when you get it it just feels amazing,positive
im in my first year of engineering looking to go into cs and this video makes me extremely excited for my coming education ive already watched so many of your videos and theyve all had a similar effect thank you so much,positive
i study mathematics physics and architecture by definition this man is an oracle in the strict meaning of the word with all honesty i never imagined someone explaining complex topics with the dexterity this man has he is literally an institution and an outstanding teacher the computer graphics and the illustrations are simply perplexing this guy never evades complexity he never evades complex arguments he illustrate the complexity and dive into the exhaustive explanation of the details its extremely rare to see a professor and a dedicated user to put a lot of effort explaining animating and describing mathematics the way he does,neutral
i am just astounded i spent so much time trying to understand this concept everywhere i looked people would show the similar neural network animation but no one ever really explained and exemplified every single step layer term and mathematics behind it the video is really well structured and with amazing animations extremely well done my mind is so blown i can barely write this comment,positive
940 i have a question here for example if that is a part around the 7 this part is a certain amount of pixels in the square it looks like you always have to write the numbers in the middle so that the network recognizes this is it possible that you write a 7 on the far right or on the left or on the top or bottom and the network recognizes that anyway,neutral
i am programming for more than ten years and i never saw anyone explain a complex idea by such a clean and clear terms well done,positive
thank you so much for the visualizations i think if math teachers always refer to how it pictorially looks the intuition would be easier to get this is why you and dr strang from mit have good content,positive
finally ml thank you so much i would be interested in a beyond 100sec or more short vids in this topic keep it up ,positive
you know every time i want to learn some new framework or language i come here for your 100 seconds series every time you manage to explain whats important about a topic in barely 2 minutes which drives people like me to want to learn more love your vids editing today was  as always,positive

spectacularly well done video on fairly complex topics im new to machine learning in general and i want to learn more ill be watching your other videos on related topics next thank you,positive
i always find it interesting that the statement logistic regression is a classification method is repeated so often despite regression being right there in the name like decision trees cart random forest and other similar methods there are both regression and classification versions of the method in a binary outcome problem we model the process as flipping a coin that has a probability p of coming up heads 1 and 1p of coming up tails 0 we can either predict p a continuous value between 0 and 1 or we can predict the outcome itself which is in 01 the former is regression the latter is classification logistic regression predicts that probability p and logistic classification takes that probability and uses a cutoff sometimes but not always 05 to predict the outcome many times the probability is more important for example lots of the same type of customer you do not want to assume all of them are 1s when p is estimated to be 06 and sometimes the outcome is more important for example making a decision to approve an application for credit,neutral
im taking a machine learning course and this is what i needed to completely understand each method great video concise and easy to follow thanks,positive
it may surprise some people but logistic regression is in fact a regression model the output is continuous its a probability of course you can dichotomize the output and create a classifier just like you can dichotomize any score function or regression model output so the distinction between regression and classification is not so clear cut,neutral
you can also get multiclass classification where the output is more then 2 also you can use neural networks for classification also,neutral

thank you i think my education goes well with ml or ai i got a degree in psychology neurobiology focus math and cs just started pursuing python once more to go into data science,positive
you did a great job introducing the how to learn aspect of what i think stumps a lot of intimidated curious learners basically when you explained when i saw this i didnt know what it meant so i googled it that is crazily enough a big lesson to learn just hearing that at least is encouraging me to take my first independent steps to learning this stuff so of course thanks for the video,positive
this may be the best youtube tutorial ever making the process of learning this entertaining is fantastic i had to go about it in the same way and i wish there had been a video like this years ago sending this to my son thanks,positive
i had the same exact problem when i started learning too much jargon and not enough explaining the tutorial series by a channel called giantneuralnetwork was great because he teaches you not only the theory but also how to actually code a simple neural network he does it very visually and it is very well done,positive
very insightful i learned a lot thank you,positive
now thats interesting i had been seeing devops all the time on this channel and now its time to put ml dl and ds stuffs,positive

this was awesome as someone who is still only recently introduced into the cs field and interested in perhaps dabbling in mlai this was really helpful for people like me thank you,positive
the most surprising thing for me is that i have always been interested in ai but did not know what computer science classes to take to follow this through i ended up taking a fundamentals to data science class this semsester and it taught me much of the basic ai algorithms that you mentioned i guess luck is on my side lol,positive
also it may be wise to learn matlab to a fairly advanced level before doing ml the jump from basic python to ml is quite a big one i was not able to make that jump and got fired from my job because of it you must know how to populate matrices by row and column take the average etc a basic python course wont cover these things but matlab courses are more specific for the type of things you will be doing as an machine learning engineer or data scientist,negative
hey tim good video one thing i would say is that i wouldnt recommend beginners to start with reinforcement learning as a matter of fact i think thats one of the more advanced applications supervised learning with neural nets or computer vision would be my suggestions before going to reinforcement,positive
you’re an amazing speaker and explain concepts very well thanks for your invaluable videos,positive
really liked the stepbystep breakdown of the process the whole video was very informative,positive
laurence thank you so much for taking the time to put out such concise intuitive walkthroughs you manage to make everything going on behind the curtain really accessible and unintimidating,positive

you should learn machine learning even if you dont intend to be a machine learning engineer ml is a tool an important one that can help make sense from data in the future knowing how to use ml as a tool will be equivalent to knowing how to use excel today it doesnt mean that everyone needs to know how to build a spreadsheet application but one would be highly handicapped if he or she doesnt know how to use one,positive
ml reminds me big datas hype few years ago some senior software engineers were scared of being overtaken by junior if they did not learn it so they wanted to train themselves puting an hadoop stack in every single projects they were working on until they eventually understood it was not the holy grail of data processing it just allows to solve some problems and not all in a more efficient way than other methods i think people in tech industry should all learn what ml is what it can do hardware requierments and what gains it can provide so they can know if they really need it then maybe they should learn it in depth but first search if there is an existing product that meet their requierements i learnt how to make train and use neural networks 20 years ago as part of my academical training did i make nn since then no did i have used libs or services relying on nn yes quite often thats quite a different thing,neutral
well as someone who likes research in ai i give major credit to software engineer the math is pretty intense to always remember so software engineers are very good at making black boxes that are reusable so i think everyone in technology is just as important,positive
i absolutely agree with you from my experience toward my research machine learning is only useful if there is data available to extract features however if you are extracting features from unknown observation then modelbased approach is very useful these days a hybrid between modelbased approach and machine learning techniques are useful,positive
great video smitha i have been working as a developer for about a year now and i just landed a job as a data scientist i’m hoping to transition into ml in a few years,positive
thank you for the honest talk the more i learn about machine learning the more i realize that what you say is true at the same time everyone is different some people will simply do anything to work in ml and thats okay,positive
i took an introductory crash course and some of the simple projects that we did were so cool that i want to learn more about ml and make more exciting projects thanks for guidance,positive
thank you for the info however i think this advice applies to just about every career especially in the fast changing world we are in even accounting has to be looked at,positive

this lecture is awesome and really inspiring ive been a fan now for years now lex and im really happy to see your success i just wanted to point out that i believe your analysis of one shot learning re human bipedal locomotion might be a little off base the learning and development process that leads to bipedalism is characterized by a list of precursors like crawling sitting up and standing up this process takes usually between 1 and 2 years this time and the hundreds if not thousands of reps that come with it is needed to build from the ground up both the requisite muscular strength and the requisite neural pathways for these coordinations to be possible the process can be accelerated through coordinationspecific training on the part of the parents which occurs quite often errors that occur in this process lead to hardcore biomechanical problems down the road eg requiring knee replacement at 55 bipedalism is pretty complex and is way harder than quadrupedalism which would fall more in the scope of your one shot learning claim,positive
a great introduction lecture full of “fruit” i learned a lot in just a hour thanks a lot for sharing,positive
this is great amazing lecture one question though about the baby walking isnt it very hard to quantify the data points synaptic firing a babies brain accesses when learning to walk if we dont fully understand the brain and neurological connection how do we quantify and compare the training data between the human brain and ai,positive

thank you so much for the informative lectures better than many college level courses but how can we get an access to the notebooks,positive
great introduction just one point at 20230 tuple for single column is passed in wrong way and thats why it returned data series it should be dflocstart instead of dflocstart to get the dataframe as in pyhton brackets are used for expressions or for functions 23 will be evaluated into 5 and start will be evaluated into string start and thus when there is single element in a tuple it must be represented with comma at the end,neutral

i am 41 i wish i had had the education those kids were getting the string activity was awesome to understand how connected we are,positive
insightful film also loved how all the characters were brought together at the end,positive
if you really dig in deeper to find ais and machine learning reaching capabilities then theyre really greater than us but always in specific sense they doesnt posses capability to be more general like human but they outperform humans by incredible power in given specific tasks,positive
it is not a question if ai is good or bad it is a question of using it in a good or bad way another thing is many people resist change of any type resisting change means that those people will be totally unable to cope when the change becomes everywhere,negative
if the old guy is my grandfather i think we would be talking about technologies all day long nice video,positive
love it thats why i teach kids between 9 and 12 how to code educating the next generation,positive

great video i like the structure and the depth of knowledge shown in it,positive
this would be substantially more terrifying if the bots werent drawn to be so cute,negative
the true existential crisis comes when you realise he just described evolution in general we can recreate it we benefit from it yet we have no clue why or how its actually working beyond luck,negative
when grey was talking about the warehouses and slaughterhouses all i could do was think of star wars the bots are basically equivalent to clones on kamino i would say the bots are less sentient but the way grey has depicted them makes that less certain and the comparison all the stronger,negative
the topology of the learning network is based on that of the perceptron built in the 50s with relays in the end the network conduct a converging weighting of probabilities to identify the correct event yes even a picture is considered an event a static one though a dinamic event is defined by using vector spaces thank you for the nice video,positive
this is absolutely insane i love this video and the way it explains everything though i guess that isnt specific to this video,positive
teacher bot cant teach but it can test did you just explain the entire american school system,negative
checking in again after a google engineer claimed their lamda ai was sentient this isnt the type of machine learning that ai uses but still fascinating,positive
as a comp sci student i find it interesting how you explained this but rather than “teaching” i would more describe it as “evolution” you know like only the strongest or most fit for whatever task survive till the next generation just like in real life birds might not know why they fly south only that they do so every year same with the bots and their tasks i think explaining this way at least for me is easier because bots don’t “learn” they evolve through the generations,neutral

its not always that you want an unlimited dataset in machine learning sometimes you want to limit your dataset for example if youre trying to figure out if youre in a stock market recession or expansion you dont want to go over 2 years months of data because youll end up in another cycle symmetry and domain limits are important in machine learning my point is sometimes too much data is a waste of time and resources,negative
thanks a lot mit if it is possiblecould you make the videos of 1804 complex variable with applicationsi really want to watch that coursethank you very much,positive
correction 406 i say that the difference in fits between the training dataset and the testing dataset is called variance however i should have said that the difference is a consequence of variance technically variance refers to the amount by which the predictions would change if we fit the model to a different training data set support statquest by buying my book the statquest illustrated guide to machine learning or a study guide or merch,neutral
lol what a way to present dry material with a dry approach yet making it interesting and easy to follow great job,positive
better than lots of courses on udemy i really like your humor,positive
notes for myself def of bias the inability for a machine learning method to capture the true relationship is called bias def of variance the difference in fits between data sets is called variance,neutral
wow this was so straight to the point with great visuals that i managed to figure out all in one go great stuff,positive
you just did it in a perfect way ive read blogs best ml books and other resources but you just nailed this thank you,positive

hello great videos loved this series can you please do a video on imbalanced data sets in classifications problems maybe just add onto a previous example you have but with a case where there are very few 1 or true values compared to 0 or false thanks for you consideration,positive
got 10 score when c4 for iris data set thank you sir your machine learning playlist is a boon for beginners like me,positive
hello sir thank you for your videos it really helps from the beginner of the video which you have listed in data science playlist  the model in default method is 9965 in train and 994 in test whereas gamma method will lower down the accuracy of the model from 994 to 75 therefore it has explicit shows the gamma method is unsuitable for the scenario however the regularisation has improve the train set to 1 and testing set is retained the best accuracy of model yet kernel parameter as linear has also provided a good accuracy of model thank you for your guidance,positive
thank you very much for these videos they are really helpful i did the exercise and got 99 when c4 any increase in c did not affect the accuracy also any alteration made to gamma and kernel dropped the accuracy drastically thank you once again,positive
great sir can you elaborate something about plotting the hyperplane the decision function in matplotlib i want to see the best line which classifies the data,positive
in linear kernel score is 969 percent and in rbf kernel score is 40 percent with gamma value the score is 006 and with the regularization value the score is around 45 83 percent,neutral

what a wonderfull tutorial well done and well explained thanks a lot dude for the sharing of this expensive knowledge,positive
hope you all enjoy this video go subscribe to ryans channel for more machinelearning content,positive
the hard part about machine learning is not the how but the what i can plot learning curves very easily but reading them is another story thats why i like to focus my ml videos on the concepts rather than the code chances are that the code is doable in two lines but if you cant understand the output or why your data might give you certain kinds of output youre wasting time and resources,neutral
just about to finish my first year studying statistics a short course was about machine learning so i have some knowledge and understanding of machine learning so this was a very interesting video we got to use and tweak different types of predictor models we split the available data into training and test data and then used the training data which included the outcome variable to build the models and the test data which didnt include the outcome variable to test the models and later compare their results to the true outcome variable,positive
good interview but as someone who has already know the concept of data science and machine learning im actually interested to know what are the differences between a data scientist and a ml engineer hope this question will be answered in a future video,positive
hey ryan or clement or both lol quick question if you had to place these in certain categories for their specific useswhat each one excels at what categories would you put each of these machine learning frameworkstool kits tensor flow pytorch mxnet and hugging face in,neutral

hello how are you from my point of view the video is very good and quite didactic however if you want to reach an even wider audience considering that in most developing countries education is precarious and a significant part of the potential audience does not speak english i suggest 1 to associate the subtitles even if in english as this would allow those who do not master the language to provide the translation of the entire text or parts of them not well understood precisely by the lack of mastery 2 that the narrator speaks in a more leisurely way as this would also benefit the audience that has not yet mastered the language thanks for the attention thanks for the video and i wish all success to the simplilearn team,positive

all i want to say that you are a blessing and i commend your dedication and effort even coming from a phd in computer engineering your materials have helped me a lot i wish you the best in all your endeavors,positive
i was searching all around the internet for something like this most i found are saying that we need to start with insert ml related topic here but i felt that something was missing when you started by saying that a good ml engineer should first be a good software engineer i knew right away that this is whats missing it makes complete sense to start there and then move up the ladder thank you for taking the time to creating all of this,neutral
hey there firstly i cant thank you enough for starting this channel  im here after i saw your video about how to pick up the basic skills to become a data analyst in 3 months video and want to let you know that i had started the google data analytics course on coursera about 45 days ago and have finished 2 courses in the certificate series do you think it is possible for me to pick up the same skills you mentioned in your video through this course do you think the google badge on the certificate might give it an edge i honestly feel the pathway you described in your video takes a more in depth approach which might be beneficial would really really love to hear your thoughts on this it would really mean a lot if you replied thank you,positive
hi sir could you recommend us the resources for additional skills you mentioned as well,neutral
thank you so much for all that you do sir they are extremely helpful,positive
thanks for your time and effort the way you have designed and presented is awesome you made many peoples life easier thanks again,positive
this channel is such a blessing and a goldmine of quality content also loved the soothing background music,positive
i would also like to point out that actually understanding machine learning well enough to tweak models effectively or read white papers on topics as was mentioned as a benefit being part of something will be extremely difficult to do without a fairly high level of knowledge in linear algebra and probability statistics in fact at my university in order to enrol in the first machine learning course you need to have taken 4 semesters of calculus with proofs as it highlights mathematical maturity one develops one or two courses in linear algebra and 2 courses in statistics that’s not to say it’s impossible to use ml without that of course it isn’t however it is difficult to engage academically with the material without sufficient math knowledge much more so than with required programming knowledge for ml so yes you will be “a part of something” in that as the field develops you might have fun new models to play around with but it’s a bit disingenuous to suggest people will be able to comprehend ml publications at a meaningful level or be generating their own custom models,neutral
in my eyes the second con is the worst thing that can happen to you in ml in many cases i would eagerly wait for about 56 hours for the model to train to see it not work at all in the way i intended id keep training the model day after day after making small changes in the code to see its performance not getting better at all,negative
pros it is fun cons you have to work don’t thank me,neutral
tim always posts videos on topics that i am currently practicinghave in mind these coincidences happens so much its scary lol love your vids ,positive
im taking a few online ml tutorials and have a text book not related to the course and i have to say that it is very similar to what i did in econometric with regards to predicting the regression analysis in ml is the same as i did in econometric but i just i didnt use python to do it i was using stata but you could use r to do the same thing and now days im sure they are teaching python in economics at any rate even after taking econometrics and taking a ml course i still find it hard to use this knowledge for anything specific or maybe more aptly how to apply this knowledge to anything useful albeit i do recognize that ml is a large topic and the first part of learning ml that i am doing including the textbook all start off doing regression analysis and maybe that is what everyone doesnt use when they talk about ml and the other parts i have yet to get to like ai and neural networks is all the rage that everyone is talking about idk i often hear people say that ml is used for large datasets like at netflix google amazon or etc to help suggest something or something along those lines well thats all fine and good but i dont work at a company like netflix or google in terms of having that much data or that level of skill the other problem is that to use ml at such companies is not really covered as they simple will say in the textbook or ml course that it is very complicated and wont go into thus kind of making the example of these fang companies almost useless in the short term and medium term when you learn about ml you often will be taught forecasting and you will be able to display it on a nice chartgraph with a line through it eg the trend line technically you could use excel to reproduce some of the things i have learned in ml so at times feels kind of pointless and demotivating or other things in ml like predict a single element if you have data on peoples age salary and whether or not they bought a car you can then ask your data if someone at 30 years old and that makes 70k will they buy a car it will be based off a percentage of course but it will come out as a 1 or 0 indicating they bought it or not the problem is normally at the end of all these tutorials the instructor will say something like the data you see in real life will never look like this and say this is for educational purposes and real life application is much harder as it has more variables etc so it becomes hard to do your own projects in ml because they dont really explain what variables you should be including or looking at for your own projects most of the time the ml tutorials focuses on how to do the predicationtrend line and not care how you got the data and what data items you should be using they just give you datasets from a website or make their own dataset this is a huge issue if you want to try doing ml on your own data because they dont teach you what data you should be capturing or what practical purposes you could use this for on a smaller scale such as a smallmedium business or say your website has x amount of traffic etc im often left wondering how the ml regression analysis chart that has a slope and line of best fit will be used in anything that they mention such as the things they say at the start of the chapter for example in my book they talk about using ml to create a spam filter and then you start off at the basics of learning about linear regression or they talk about using housing price data to predict how expensive a house will be based off like 57 factors but to be honest the housing sample is a great example but i often have trouble trying to think of a problem that i could create using ml to predict a result ie my own project also the examples often are intuitive like yeah the bigger a house the more expensive its going to be i dont even need data or run ml on it to know that it can get demotiving at times so the examples are illustrator of basically what you already know to be true like predicting gas prices will be higher in the summer time because more people drive because of more people take vacationtravel during summer also they never mention how to implement that line graph into an application like the mentioned spam filter its 200 pages like that countless hours of videos from tutorials saying now of course the real life data will not look anything like this but you get the idea i am kind of stuck inbetween smashing my head against the wall listening to the instructor on how a graph with a slope is ml and hoping that the next item they teach will get me to what i want im tempted to skip 20 hours or 200 pages ahead and dive into the neural networks but cant stop thinking that maybe regression analysis is going to be required or some of the tricks you are suppose to learn along the way will be helpful in the ai section or whatever so far its like learning basic statistics but in python,neutral
im a data scientist and 95 of my job is data collection and preparation its still a cool job but its not all model development,positive
at first i thought i will learn machine learning in 6 months with some coding experience i dedicated 5 hours on normal day and 10 hours a day on weekends to study the field and make it in 6 months and guess what in reality it took me 1 year of hard working and studying this field to be able to build deploy deep learning models and to only begin comprehending state of the art models and begin to mix different algorithms to solve a specific problem time may vary from person to other but real hard work and dedication is required if i was to go back and change the way i learned things rather than just jumping to the field first to learn data structures and algorithms programming logic then try to learn and apply some basic algorithms like binary search reverse linked list string manipulation this will help you so much to improve coding skills the first step will help you so much in processing data solving problems related to data and getting your models to work using your own way second learn some basic calculus and statistics linear algebra probability dot product gradient descent third learn machine learning algorithms and try to apply them using your programming skills,neutral
the only thing holding me back is that it took about 30 mins to implement a classification algorithm with a data size of around 20 numbers on a powerful laptop it was straightforward and a lot of fun but when the size of the data increases it might go on for even a week with gpus it pays well but so does frontend development at any decent company this video didnt give any valuable inputs to make a decision,negative
imo machine learning is a lot of math it is very difficult to find an interesting job without advance degree if it is the goal of learning ml,neutral
tim you should post more about machine learning also please try to make a video on how to use the model for production it will be really helpful,positive

you have the best way to describe what machine learning is i was wondering what its real meaning and i then found your answer in video i recommend all who dont know the meaning to see this video thanks oxford,positive
great introduction question is it always the case that humans need to input the potential features that are used for classification for instance the ml algorithm uses the animals height length and face size as features for classification with computer vision being used to map images to these features do some ml algorithms create these features and features maps automatically or are these always created outside of the algorithm ps what did you use to create this video it looks great,positive
i love the way you explained plus the diversity,positive
ai is already here and that is not such a bad thing can computers become self aware yes i think so in the not too distant future,positive

i am currently enrolled in a msc machine learning masters here in the uk and we are learning both the theory and putting it into practice using the assignments there really isnt a problem of doing it both stop telling yourself you cant if you put in the time and effort with the right learning mindset and method you can learn to eat and drink at the same time just need to be smart about it stop putting these limiting thoughts on yourself it really isnt that hard,positive
i came for a machine learning related talk but i got a life lesson thanks daniel nice content ps i was thinking about going into ml field but i now realized its due to engineer disease im sticking with web apps at least for some time until i can decide what i love and what i dont,positive
ive worked for about 2 years with mlcomputer vision and a lot of the things in this video resonated when i started out i was frustrated that i couldnt dive directly into designing new advanced mathematical models right away but i realized there are a lot of boring things that need to be in place before thats even relevant data curation annotation testing frameworks etc just to name a few there are a lot of interesting problems to solve along the way that i probably wouldnt even realize existed if i stayed in academia for a phd i think there is a point to be made for switching back and forth between learning tools for the sake of tools and solving problems though as long as you spend enough effort to make some progress each time it can really help keeping things fresh,positive
i come from a physics background and usually we spend a lot of time concerning with theory trying to enrich our theoretical knowledge as much as we can a lot of colleagues in my department dont understand that trying to learn everything is an infinite loop during my masters i realized how important is to just start doing things with curiosity which led me to collaborate in two amazing projects now that im finishing my masters and starting to get into ml engineering i see how this mindset is even more crucial to let you accomplish the things you want amazing content you put there mate thanks from brazil,positive
back when i was learning to code i didn’t know anything or what to do and how to do it i asked a friend of mine how i could what books i should read etc first thing he did was stop me in my sentence and say “you don’t need to research all these functions and data structures and take notes from textbooks you just need to know what is possible” and that really reasonated with me because once you know what is possible you can think of a problem and as the video states “learn by doing” my friend said to work i’m projects i want to solve or replicate and implement what i have learned that way rather than sitting around reading these books,neutral
i really like the point about engineering toolboxes i think that’s where a lot of the burnout comes from i work in devops and teach full stack so going to school for machine learning sounds like a large leap learning how to build better ml pipelines are much more worth my time,positive
i’ve just started exploring this field and this was a really good reminder to get so early on the journey thanks a lot,positive

hey daniel just discovered your channel a couple days ago and im learning lots thank you,positive
this is great focus is key a playful approach can also speed things up depending on how you learn and of course patience for those interested in r and python the latest r studio ide is great and allows you to run both side by side with reticulate it can seem a steep curve but those with a grounding in r and statistics you can run ml scripts side by side and learn the similarities and where they differ,positive
