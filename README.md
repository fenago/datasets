Michael Jordan and Shaquille O'Neil Career Stats:  Classification (Win is the Target Variable) </br>
NBA shot logs: Data on shots taken during the 2014-2015 season, which player took the shot, where on the floor was the shot taken from, who was the nearest defender, how far away was the nearest defender, time on the shot clock, and much more.</br>
Diamonds : Multiclass Classification and/or Regression</br>
This list is the diamonds dataset. It is ideal in length for practice (+50k samples) and has multiple targets you can predict as a regression or a multi-class classification task
🎯 Targets: ‘carat’ or ‘price’</br>
🔗 Link: Kaggle</br>
📦Dimensions: (53940, 10)</br>
⚙Missing values: No</br>

Abalone Dataset:  Classification / Regression (Male/Female or Age)
This is a unique dataset from the field of zoology. The task is to predict the age of Abalone shells (a type of mollusk) using several physical measurements. Traditionally, their age is found by cutting through their cone, staining them, and counting the number of rings inside the shell under a microscope.
</br>
🎯 Target: ‘Rings’</br>

Cancer death rate Dataset</br>
This dataset challenges you to find cancer mortality rate per capita (100,000) using several demographic variables. These data were aggregated from a number of sources including the American Community Survey (census.gov), clinicaltrials.gov, and cancer.gov. Most of the data preparation process can be veiwed here.</br>
🎯 Target: ‘TARGET_deathRate’</br>

Life Expectancy (WHO)</br>
How long will a person live? This is one of the hardest questions unanswered in science. Several studies have been undertaken to understand human life and longevity, and this dataset provided by WHO (World Health Organization) is one of them</br>
🎯 Target: ‘Life expectancy.’</br>
🔗 Link: Kaggle</br>
📦Dimensions: (2938, 21)</br>
⚙Missing values: Yes</br>

Car prices
The title says it all — predict car prices using variables like mileage, fuel type, transmission, and several domain-specific features. This is also an excellent dataset for pumping out your feature engineering muscles.

🎯 Target: ‘selling_price’
🔗 Link: Kaggle
📦Dimensions: (8128, 12)
⚙Missing values: Yes

## Binary classification
7️⃣. NBA rookie stats
The first binary classification dataset in the list requires you to predict if a rookie basketball player will last more than 5 years in the league:

🎯 Target: ‘TARGET_5Yrs’
🔗 Link: Data.world
📦Dimensions: (8128, 12)
⚙Missing values: Yes

 Stroke prediction
Another medical dataset asks you to predict whether a patient will have a stroke or not based on their history with interesting features:
🎯 Target: ‘stroke’
🔗 Link: Kaggle
📦Dimensions: (5110, 11)
⚙Missing values: Yes

Water potability
Safe drinking water is the most basic human right and a major influencer on health. Using this dataset, you should classify water bodies into potable (drinkable) and not potable using several chemical properties:
🎯 Target: ‘Potability’
🔗 Link: Kaggle
📦Dimensions: (3276, 10)
⚙Missing values: Yes

Smart grid stability
This is an augmented version of the “Electrical Grid Stability Simulated Dataset” created by Vadim Arzamasov. It is donated to UCI and made available on Kaggle. You will be predicting the stability of 4-node smart grid systems (whatever they mean):

🎯 Target: ‘stabf’
🔗 Link: Kaggle
📦Dimensions: (60000, 13)
⚙Missing values: No

 IBM HR analytics & employee attrition
This fictional dataset created by IBM datasets tasks you to uncover which factors lead to employee attrition (whether they will leave their role):
🎯 Target: ‘Attrition’
🔗 Link: Kaggle
📦Dimensions: (1470, 35)
⚙Missing values: No

Can I eat this mushroom?
Another one-of-a-kind dataset is classifying mushrooms into edible and poisonous. It also presents a unique challenge — all features are categorical:
🎯 Target: ‘class’
🔗 Link: Kaggle
📦Dimensions: (8124, 23)
⚙Missing values: Yes

Banknote authentication
Even though this dataset has very few features, I wanted to include it because the task is really interesting — using physical attributes of banknotes, you should classify them into forged or original:
🎯 Target: ‘class’
🔗 Link: Kaggle
📦Dimensions: (1372, 5)
⚙Missing values: No

Adult income dataset
Predict whether a person will end up earning more than 50k using factors like age, education, background, gender, marital status, etc.:
🎯 Target: ‘income’
🔗 Link: Kaggle
📦Dimensions: (48842, 15)
⚙Missing values: Yes

## Multi-class classification datasets
Yeast classification
This dataset will give you a small taste from the world of microbiology. You are tasked to classify a fungus called yeast into species:
